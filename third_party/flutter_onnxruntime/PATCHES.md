# flutter_onnxruntime (Hibiki vendored fork)

Vendored from pub.dev `flutter_onnxruntime` **1.8.3**. Referenced via
`dependency_overrides` (`path: ../third_party/flutter_onnxruntime`) in
`fushi/pubspec.yaml`.

## Why vendored

All five native platforms (Android / iOS / Linux / macOS / Windows) are enabled
— Hibiki's built-in manga OCR runs locally on every one of them. The fork keeps
the **Apple deployment floor** at the true `onnxruntime-objc` minimum and makes
the Windows plugin's advertised `DIRECT_ML` provider a real execution path.

Upstream ships a `Package.swift` next to each Apple podspec. When those exist,
Flutter builds the plugin through **Swift Package Manager**, which pulls
`masicai/onnxruntime-swift-package-manager` — and that package's manifest
declares `platforms: [.iOS(.v15), .macOS(.v14)]`. Because Hibiki's macOS Runner
already uses `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage`, the macOS 14 floor propagates
to the whole app:

```
error: package 'flutter-onnxruntime' requires minimum platform version 14.0
```

Upstream's podspecs then mirror that with `s.platform = :ios, '16.0'` /
`:osx, '14.0'`. But the **pod** those podspecs actually depend on,
`onnxruntime-objc` 1.23.0, declares only:

| | onnxruntime-objc 1.23.0 | upstream plugin declares | this fork |
|---|---|---|---|
| iOS | 15.1 | 16.0 | **15.1** |
| macOS | 13.4 | 14.0 | **13.4** |

So routing Apple through CocoaPods instead of SwiftPM buys back iOS 15.1–16.0
and macOS 13.4–14.0 for free, with no change to the ORT binary or the Dart API.

## Delta vs upstream 1.8.3

1. Deleted `ios/flutter_onnxruntime/Package.swift` and
   `macos/flutter_onnxruntime/Package.swift`. With no Swift package manifest,
   Flutter falls back to the podspecs on both Apple platforms. The Swift/ObjC++
   sources stay where they are (`<platform>/flutter_onnxruntime/Sources/...`) —
   the podspecs already glob that SPM-shaped layout, so nothing else moves.
2. `ios/flutter_onnxruntime.podspec`: `s.platform = :ios, '16.0'` -> `'15.1'`.
3. `macos/flutter_onnxruntime.podspec`: `s.platform = :osx, '14.0'` -> `'13.4'`.
4. Deleted the `example/` and `doc/` folders (build-irrelevant, reduce vendored
   size).
5. `environment.sdk` widened `^3.7.0` -> `>=3.5.0 <4.0.0` to match the Hibiki
   workspace floor (per the other `third_party/` vendored packages).
6. Windows downloads the pinned official
   `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML` 1.22.0 and `Microsoft.AI.DirectML`
   1.15.4 NuGet artifacts (SHA-256 pinned), bundles `onnxruntime.dll`,
   `onnxruntime_providers_shared.dll`, and `DirectML.dll`, and handles
   `DIRECT_ML` through ORT's
   `OrtDmlApi::SessionOptionsAppendExecutionProvider_DML` with the required
   sequential execution mode. The upstream generic Windows ORT archive is
   CPU-only, so its Dart enum previously led only to `INVALID_PROVIDER`.
7. Windows error replies are normalised to UTF-8 before they cross the method
   channel (`WindowsUtils::toUtf8Message`, and every `result->Error` in
   `flutter_onnxruntime_plugin.cpp` routed through the single `FailWith` exit).

   Upstream hands `e.what()` to the channel verbatim. ONNX Runtime builds its
   Windows messages by appending the system error text, which `FormatMessage`
   renders in the machine's **ANSI code page** — GBK on a Chinese Windows. The
   channel's string contract is UTF-8 and Dart's decoder is strict, so the reply
   does not merely arrive garbled, it stops being decodable at all: the caller
   gets `FormatException: Unexpected extension byte (at offset N)` and the real
   failure is gone. Measured here: a failing DirectML session produced a
   240-byte message whose 228th byte began `参数错误。` in GBK, which is exactly
   the offset the user saw (BUG-2034).

   Valid UTF-8 is passed through untouched — model paths containing non-ASCII
   are genuine UTF-8 written by ORT's own `ToUTF8String`, and re-decoding those
   as ANSI would corrupt them. The local well-formedness check is deliberately
   at least as strict as Dart's `utf8.decode` (rejects overlong forms, UTF-16
   surrogates and anything past U+10FFFF); anything looser would let a string
   pass here and still blow up on the far side.

8. `windows/flutter_onnxruntime_plugin.cpp` + `lib/src/ort_session.dart`:
   `OrtSessionOptions.freeDimensionOverrides` (`Map<String, int>`) is forwarded
   to ORT's `AddFreeDimensionOverrideByName`.

   The zipformer encoder declares symbolic `N`/`T`, so ORT re-plans the whole
   graph on every `Run` — measured 19k frames/s on a 4070 Ti with DirectML.
   Pinning both dimensions lets ORT fuse the model into a single DML graph:
   129k frames/s at N=32/T=550, outputs identical to the dynamic session to
   within 1e-5. The ORT C++ wrapper shipped with this version does not expose
   the call, hence the raw `Ort::GetApi()` use.

   Windows-only by construction: the other platform plugins never read the key
   and silently ignore it. The Dart-side consumer must therefore gate on the
   execution provider actually in use (`AsrStaticEncoderPool` is created only
   for DirectML), because a session built with the key on a platform that
   ignores it stays dynamic and accepts the static-shaped tensors anyway — it
   is 5-7x slower with no error anywhere.

9. `windows/src/async_dispatch.{h,cc}` (new) + `windows/src/session_manager.*` +
   `windows/flutter_onnxruntime_plugin.cpp`: `runInference`, `createSession`
   and `closeSession` no longer execute inside the method-call handler on the
   platform (UI) thread. Argument parsing and input cloning still happen
   there; the ORT work is posted to one of two `WorkQueue` worker threads —
   sessions created with a GPU provider (DirectML / CUDA) share one queue,
   CPU sessions the other — and the `MethodResult` is completed back on the
   platform thread through `PlatformThreadDispatcher` (a message-only window
   + `PostMessage`). `SessionInfo::session` became a `shared_ptr` so a run in
   flight survives `closeSession`, and `SessionManager::runInference` holds
   the map mutex only for the lookup, not for `Run` itself.

   Two classes of work, one thread each, is deliberate: DirectML crashes when
   two sessions issue `Run` concurrently from two threads in one process
   (reproduced with the Python `onnxruntime-directml` build), while a GPU run
   and a CPU run overlap fine. The audiobook ASR pipeline relies on exactly
   that overlap (GPU encoder ‖ CPU greedy search): 30 min of English went
   from 8.0–8.9 s to 6.1–6.6 s, and the UI thread stopped freezing for the
   duration of every encoder run and every static-shape session build.
   `FLUTTER_ONNXRUNTIME_SYNC=1` in the process environment restores the
   upstream inline behaviour for A/B timing and for isolating threading bugs.

10. `windows/src/dxgi_memory.{h,cc}` (new) + `windows/flutter_onnxruntime_plugin.cpp`
    + `lib/src/onnxruntime.dart` / `flutter_onnxruntime_platform_interface.dart`
    / `flutter_onnxruntime_method_channel.dart` / `lib/flutter_onnxruntime.dart`:
    a `getDeviceMemoryInfo` method returning the DXGI local video-memory
    budget of an adapter (`OrtDeviceMemoryInfo`; `null` on every other platform
    and when DXGI cannot answer). Static-shape DirectML graphs allocate every
    intermediate up front and keep the pool resident per session; a card whose
    budget cannot hold them does not fail — it spills into system memory and
    throughput collapses. The Dart consumer (`asrEncoderBucketsForBudget`)
    sizes its encoder buckets from this number before building any session.

11. `windows/flutter_onnxruntime_plugin.cpp`: CPU sessions no longer share
    the single `cpuQueue_` worker for `runInference` / `closeSession`. Each
    CPU session gets its own `WorkQueue` (created on first use, kept in
    `cpuSessionQueues_`, retired on the platform thread right after the
    close reply), so independent CPU sessions run concurrently while every
    session's own calls stay FIFO. `cpuQueue_` remains for session creation
    (no id yet). GPU sessions still share `gpuQueue_`. The consumer is the
    ASR greedy search: two sessions of the same Loop graph each take half of
    a batch's rows (the Loop graph is frame-sequential and tops out at ~4
    intra-op threads, so one session leaves most cores idle).

    A note on delta #9's "DirectML crashes with two sessions on two threads"
    rationale: that was reproduced with the *Python* `onnxruntime-directml`
    build, whose DML provider factory (`python_api=true` in
    `dml_provider_factory.cc`) deliberately shares one `Dml::ExecutionContext`
    (and thus one command queue) across every session in the process. The
    native C API path this plugin uses creates a separate D3D12 command queue
    and execution context per session, so that reproduction does not carry
    over — concurrent DML sessions are *untested* here, not excluded. It also
    does not matter yet: the 2026-09-07 nvidia-smi measurement showed the
    encoder GPU idle ~85% of the time for lack of queued work, which is what
    the Dart-side pipeline rewrite (`AsrBatchPipeline`) addresses.

**The Dart API under `lib/` carries two deltas (#8, the
`freeDimensionOverrides` option, and #10, `getDeviceMemoryInfo`); everything
else there is byte-for-byte upstream.** The Apple, Android and Linux native
trees are untouched; the Windows tree carries deltas 6–11 above — provider
wiring, error-string encoding, free-dimension overrides, worker-thread
dispatch, the DXGI budget query and per-session CPU workers. No ORT wrapper
or inference logic changed anywhere.

Guards: `fushi/test/ocr/onnxruntime_windows_error_encoding_guard_test.dart`
keeps delta 7 in place,
`fushi/test/onnx/onnxruntime_free_dimension_override_guard_test.dart` keeps
delta 8, `fushi/test/onnx/onnxruntime_async_dispatch_guard_test.dart` keeps
deltas 9 and 11 and `fushi/test/onnx/onnxruntime_device_memory_guard_test.dart`
keeps delta 10 — a re-vendor that drops either half of any of them fails a guard. Delta 8 needs a
guard more than the others do because losing only its C++ half is **silent**:
Dart keeps putting the key in the map, the plugin no longer reads it, the
session falls back to dynamic shapes, and every result stays correct while the
encoder runs 5-7x slower.

## Deployment targets this fork requires

The app projects must stay at or above the podspec floors, or `pod install`
fails outright:

- `fushi/ios/Podfile` — `platform :ios, '15.1'`
- `fushi/ios/Runner.xcodeproj` — `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 15.1` (3 configs)
- `fushi/macos/Podfile` — `platform :osx, '13.4'`
- `fushi/macos/Runner.xcodeproj` — `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.4` (3 configs)

Guard: `fushi/test/tools/onnxruntime_apple_gate_guard_test.dart` pins all four
plus the podspec floors, so a re-vendor cannot silently reintroduce the SwiftPM
path or drift the floors apart.

## Re-vendoring on upgrade

Copy the new upstream version over this folder, then re-apply deltas #1–#11.
Before bumping the `onnxruntime-objc` pin, check the new version's podspec
platforms (`pod spec cat onnxruntime-objc --version=X.Y.Z`) — if the floor moved,
the four project deployment targets and the guard test move with it.

Before bumping the Windows ORT pin, update both NuGet package versions and
SHA-256 values together, verify the DirectML package's declared
`Microsoft.AI.DirectML` dependency, and keep all three runtime DLLs in
`flutter_onnxruntime_bundled_libraries`.
