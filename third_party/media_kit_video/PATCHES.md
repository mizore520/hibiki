# Hibiki patches

This package vendors `media_kit_video` 2.0.1 (unchanged from pub.dev except for
the patches below) so Hibiki can carry fixes that are not yet upstream.

## BUG-235: seek bar `onPointerUp` use-after-dispose crash

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart`,
`MaterialDesktopSeekBarState`.

Upstream `onPointerUp()` (and `onPointerMove()`) unconditionally call
`controller(context).player.seek(...)`. `controller(context)` is
`VideoStateInheritedWidget.of(context)`, which dereferences `State.context`.

When the controls subtree is torn down while a seek-bar drag is in progress —
which Hibiki does on fullscreen enter/exit and on episode switch via
`VideoControlsFocusGate` (`fushi/lib/.../video_hibiki_page.dart`) — the pointer
release lands on a disposed `State`, and `context` is null. The crash users hit:

```text
FlutterError: Null check operator used on a null value
  at MaterialDesktopSeekBarState.onPointerUp (material_desktop.dart:987)
```

The State already guards `setState` with `if (mounted)`, but the two pointer
handlers that dereference `controller(context)` had no such guard. The patch
adds `if (!mounted) return;` to the top of both `onPointerUp()` and
`onPointerMove()`, matching the existing `mounted` guard style. `onPointerDown()`
only calls `setState` (already guarded), so it is left unchanged.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_seekbar_guard_test.dart`.

## BUG-566: mobile seek bar use-after-dispose (mirror of BUG-235)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart`,
`MaterialSeekBarState`.

The *mobile* controls have the exact same defect BUG-235 fixed on desktop:
`onPointerMove()` and `onPointerUp()` unconditionally call
`controller(context).player.seek(...)`, dereferencing `State.context` with no
`mounted` guard. Hibiki tears down the controls subtree on fullscreen
enter/exit and episode switch (`VideoControlsFocusGate`), so a drag released
right then lands on a disposed `State` (`context` is null) and crashes with
`Null check operator used on a null value`; the seek is lost either way.

The patch adds `if (!mounted) return;` to the top of both handlers, mirroring
the BUG-235 desktop patch and the State's existing `if (mounted)` setState
guard. `onPointerDown()` and the `onPan*` handlers only call `setState`
(already guarded) / widget callbacks and do not dereference `context`, so they
are left unchanged — same as desktop.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_seekbar_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-364: publish real controls visibility (`visibilityNotifier`)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart` and
`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart`, both the theme data
classes (`MaterialDesktopVideoControlsThemeData` /
`MaterialVideoControlsThemeData`) and their control States.

Hibiki disables the built-in `SubtitleView` and renders its own subtitle overlay
that dodges the bottom controls bar. Upstream keeps the controls' `visible` state
(and its auto-hide `Timer`) private in the control State and exposes no callback,
notifier, or public API. Hibiki used to keep a *separate* mirror of visibility
with its own timer; the two timers drifted out of phase and the subtitle dodge
reversed direction under concurrent input (e.g. the bar animating up/down while
the user also taps / keys). Users reported "the subtitle goes up/down the wrong
way when I do something while the seek bar appears/disappears".

The patch adds an optional `final ValueNotifier<bool>? visibilityNotifier;` to
both theme data classes (wired through their constructors and `copyWith`), and a
`void _publishVisibility()` helper in each control State that pushes the State's
real `visible` into that notifier after **every** `visible` mutation
(onHover / onEnter / onExit / onTap / mount timer / seek-end timer). The initial
(mount) visibility is published via `addPostFrameCallback` to avoid re-entering a
host listener's `setState` during `didChangeDependencies`. When no notifier is
injected the behaviour is identical to pub.dev (no publishing).

Hibiki injects one notifier through both control themes and derives its subtitle
dodge from that single source of truth (`_mediaKitControlsVisible` →
`_applyControlsVisibilityFromMediaKit` in `video_hibiki_page.dart`), deleting its
old mirror + second timer.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_visibility_notifier_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-1059: restart auto-hide timer on host signal (`restartHideTimerSignal`)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart` only, both the theme
data class (`MaterialVideoControlsThemeData`) and the mobile control State
(`_MaterialVideoControlsState`).

On mobile the controls' auto-hide `Timer` is only reset by a full-screen tap
(`onTap`) or a seek gesture. Pressing the bottom button-bar buttons (play /
skip-forward / skip-back) runs each button's own `onPressed` and never resets
the timer, so the controls vanish `controlsHoverDuration` after the last tap
even while the user is still pressing a button — the finger then lands on the
video underneath and mis-triggers a play/pause (users reported "the menu keeps
auto-hiding while I press the fast-forward/back buttons").

The patch adds an optional `final Listenable? restartHideTimerSignal;` to
`MaterialVideoControlsThemeData` (wired through its constructor and `copyWith`).
The mobile State subscribes to it in `didChangeDependencies` (re-binding when
the theme's listenable identity changes) and detaches in `dispose`. On fire, the
new `void _restartHideTimer()` — only while already `visible` — cancels and
reschedules the hide `Timer` for another `controlsHoverDuration`, mirroring the
visible-branch reset in `onTap` but **without** toggling visibility (a press on a
visible button keeps the controls up; it never un-hides them). When no signal is
injected the behaviour is identical to pub.dev.

Hibiki injects one `ChangeNotifier` (`_RestartHideTimerSignal`) through the
mobile controls theme (`restartHideTimerSignal:` in `_mobileControlsTheme`) and
pokes it from the bottom button presses via `_pokeControlsVisible()` (which, on
mobile, now fires this signal instead of the desktop synthetic-hover path — see
`controls_visibility.part.dart`).

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_restart_hide_timer_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-565: notify host on user seek-bar interaction (`onSeekStart`)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart` and
`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart`, both the theme data
classes (`MaterialDesktopVideoControlsThemeData` /
`MaterialVideoControlsThemeData`) and the seek-bar wiring in their control
States.

The subtitle list lets the user tap a row to jump to that cue
(`VideoPlayerController.skipToCue`). The jump seek lands a little before the cue
(BUG-259 pre-roll), so the controller keeps a short-lived "active jump target"
snapshot + in-flight grace window to snap the highlight to the tapped row until
the seek truly lands (TODO-565). Every Hibiki-initiated seek funnels through
`VideoPlayerController.seekMs`, which clears that snapshot first — *except* the
progress (seek) bar, which drives `controller(context).player.seek(...)` directly
inside media_kit and bypasses `seekMs`. If the user drags the bar to an earlier
cue *during* that grace window, the next tick reads the new (earlier) position,
the grace is not yet exhausted, and the stale target snaps the highlight back to
the originally tapped row for ~2s.

Upstream's seek bar exposes no host-level seek hook; its internal
`onSeekStart`/`onSeekEnd` are hard-wired to the controls' auto-hide timer and are
not surfaced through the theme. The patch adds an optional
`final void Function()? onSeekStart;` to both theme data classes (wired through
their constructors and `copyWith`), and merges `_theme(context).onSeekStart?.call()`
into the existing internal `onSeekStart` callback of each seek bar
(`MaterialSeekBar` / `MaterialDesktopSeekBar`). When no callback is injected the
behaviour is identical to pub.dev.

Hibiki injects `() => controller.clearSeekTargetSnap()` through both control
themes (`_desktopControlsTheme` / `_mobileControlsTheme` in
`video_hibiki_page.dart`), so starting a progress-bar drag invalidates the jump
snapshot just like every other seek entry point.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_seekbar_guard_test.dart`.

## BUG-796 follow-up: surface the committed seek target on drag/tap (`onSeekEnd(Duration)`)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart` and
`material.dart`, both theme data classes and the seek-bar States.

Every Hibiki-initiated seek funnels through `VideoPlayerController.seekMs`, which
(BUG-796) authoritatively re-syncs the bottom subtitle to the destination and
suppresses the *lagging* post-seek `player.state.position` (media_kit doesn't
update position synchronously with `seek`, and while **paused** it stays at the
old position for a long time — the 125ms cue tick then keeps re-affirming the
*old* subtitle, so seeking to a silent gap leaves the previous subtitle stuck on
screen). The progress (seek) bar drives `controller(context).player.seek(...)`
directly inside media_kit and bypasses `seekMs`, so it never got that protection.

Upstream's seek bar's internal `onSeekEnd` is a `VoidCallback` wired only to the
controls' auto-hide timer, and carries no target. The patch:

- adds an optional `final void Function(Duration)? onSeekEnd;` to both theme data
  classes (wired through their constructors and `copyWith`);
- **retypes** each seek bar's internal `onSeekEnd` from `VoidCallback?` to
  `void Function(Duration)?` and passes the committed target `duration * slider`
  at the `onPointerUp` seek-commit;
- merges `_theme(context).onSeekEnd?.call(target)` into that seek bar's internal
  `onSeekEnd` callback (alongside the existing auto-hide-timer logic).

When no callback is injected the behaviour is identical to pub.dev. Hibiki injects
`(Duration target) => controller.notifyExternalSeek(target.inMilliseconds)` through
**both** control themes (`_desktopControlsTheme` / `_mobileControlsTheme` in
`video_hibiki_page.dart`). `notifyExternalSeek` applies the same in-flight
protection as `seekMs` (authoritative cue re-sync + suppress the lagging position)
**without** re-issuing `player.seek` (the bar already sought). Only the commit
(pointer-up / tap) notifies; intermediate drag-move seeks do not.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_seekbar_guard_test.dart`
(group `BUG-796 follow-up: seek-bar onSeekEnd(target) patch survives re-vendor`).

## BUG-374: play/pause on `onTap` (arena-respecting), not `onTapDown`

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart`,
the central play/pause `GestureDetector` and the side-rail buttons.

Upstream binds `controller(context).player.playOrPause()` to `onTapDown`, which
fires the instant a pointer goes down — *before* the gesture arena resolves. In
Hibiki the video surface sits under ancestor gesture detectors and overlay
buttons; tapping the *edge* of a control button let the ancestor's `onTapDown`
fire play/pause too, so users hit a button edge and the video paused/played
underneath (TODO-663).

The patch moves `playOrPause()` to `onTap` (which only fires for the detector
that wins the gesture arena, so a button that claims the tap suppresses the
pass-through), and degrades `onTapDown` to only record a `_playPauseTapEligible`
flag (preserving the seek-bar-region geometry checks). The same change is applied
to the side-rail play/pause buttons on both `material_desktop.dart` and
`material.dart`. Normal "tap the video area to pause" still works — it just waits
one arena resolution (imperceptible).

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/pages/video_play_pause_tap_arena_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-669: surface seek-bar hover position (`onHoverPosition`)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart`, the desktop
theme data class (`MaterialDesktopVideoControlsThemeData`) and the desktop seek
bar (`MaterialDesktopSeekBar` / `MaterialDesktopSeekBarState`).

Hibiki adds a progress-bar hover thumbnail preview (TODO-669): hovering the seek
bar pops a thumbnail of the frame at that time. media_kit already computes the
hover fraction internally — `MaterialDesktopSeekBarState.onHover`/`onEnter` do
`percent = e.localPosition.dx / constraints.maxWidth` (the track inner width
*after* `seekBarMargin`, so it is the authoritative fraction of the track) — but
it keeps that fraction private (only used to paint its own hover highlight) and
exposes no host-level hover hook or tooltip callback.

The patch adds an optional `final void Function(double? fraction)?
onHoverPosition;` to `MaterialDesktopVideoControlsThemeData` (wired through its
constructor and `copyWith`) and to the `MaterialDesktopSeekBar` widget. The
theme's callback is forwarded into the seek-bar widget at its single construction
site, and `MaterialDesktopSeekBarState` calls `widget.onHoverPosition?.call(...)`
with the clamped fraction in `onHover`/`onEnter` and with `null` in `onExit`.
Because the fraction comes straight from the seek bar's own coordinate space, the
host never re-derives the 16px margin. When no callback is injected the behaviour
is identical to pub.dev.

Hibiki injects `onHoverPosition: _onSeekBarHover` only through the **desktop**
control theme (`_desktopControlsTheme` in `video_hibiki_page.dart`); the mobile
theme deliberately does not (touch has no hover), keeping mobile behaviour
unchanged.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_seekbar_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-916: show controls on `onTap` (arena-respecting), not `Listener.onPointerDown`

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart` (mobile controls only),
the central gesture stack of `MaterialVideoControlsState`.

Upstream wraps the controls' central fill in a raw
`Listener(onPointerDown: ... => onTap())`, so *any* pointer-down toggled the
control bar **synchronously, before the gesture arena resolved**. Hibiki layers a
self-implemented long-press speed-up (`onLongPressStart` on an ancestor
`GestureDetector`) and a Flutter subtitle overlay that dodges the bottom bar.
Because the long-press recognizer needs ~500ms to win, the initial down of a
press-and-hold always fired `onTap()` first: the control bar flashed in, started
its 2s auto-hide, then collapsed once the long-press began — the "control bar
flashes once before disappearing" symptom (TODO-916 ②). The same premature
toggle also shoved the subtitle box up via its 200ms dodge animation *mid-tap*,
so a tap aimed at a subtitle character landed on a now-moved RenderBox and missed,
which is why subtitle word lookup "needs a pause and several taps" (TODO-916 ④
amplifier).

The patch removes the `Listener`/`_handlePointerDown` wiring and binds the
existing `onTap()` to the central `GestureDetector.onTap:` instead. `onTap` only
fires for the detector that wins the arena, so a long-press or double-tap
suppresses it and the controls no longer flash. `_tapPosition` (used by
double-tap-seek segment checks) is preserved and now also recorded on `onTapDown`
in addition to `onDoubleTapDown`. `playAndPauseOnTap`, the subtitle
`shiftSubtitle`/`unshiftSubtitle` dodge, and the `visibilityNotifier` push are all
unchanged — single tap still toggles the controls, just one arena resolution later
(imperceptible). Desktop `material_desktop.dart` is untouched (it already toggles
via `MouseRegion.onHover`, never on pointer-down).

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_controls_tap_arena_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-1097: remove desktop drag-to-adjust-volume gesture

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart`,
`_MaterialDesktopVideoControlsState.build`, the central `GestureDetector`.

Upstream binds `GestureDetector.onPanUpdate` (gated by `modifyVolumeOnScroll`)
so that holding the left mouse button and dragging vertically over the video
changes the volume by `e.delta.dy`. Hibiki users found this accidental: any
click-and-drag on the video surface silently jumped the volume. TODO-1097 asks
to drop only the drag behavior on Windows/desktop while keeping every other
gesture.

The patch removes the `onPanUpdate` handler entirely (leaving the sibling
`onTap` play/pause, `onTapDown` play/pause eligibility, and `onTapUp`
double-press fullscreen untouched). The scroll-wheel volume path
(`Listener.onPointerSignal` → `PointerScrollEvent`, also gated by
`modifyVolumeOnScroll`, ~30 lines above) is intentionally **kept** — users did
not complain about the wheel and it is a separate, deliberate feature. Mobile
touch gestures (`material.dart`) and the long-press temporary speed-up
(`speed.part.dart`, a `LongPress` gesture family) are unrelated to `onPanUpdate`
and untouched.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_desktop_drag_volume_guard_test.dart`.

## TODO-1243: quantize controls playback position (integrated-GPU 100% load)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/extensions/duration.dart`
(`kPositionUiThrottleStep` + `DurationExtension.floorTo`), and the four
`player.stream.position` listeners in
`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart`
(`MaterialDesktopSeekBarState`, `MaterialDesktopPositionIndicatorState`) and
`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart`
(`MaterialSeekBarState`, `MaterialPositionIndicatorState`).

Users on integrated GPUs (`gpu0`) reported the raster thread pinned at 100%
whenever the playback-controls overlay is shown (TODO-1119/1201/1203 family:
the black-flicker under high GPU load). Root cause: libmpv publishes `time-pos`
at the *video frame rate*, so `player.stream.position` emits ~60/s. Both the
seek bar and the `mm:ss` position clock subscribe to it and `setState` on every
emit, so while the overlay is visible the seek bar fill re-rasters (and the
surrounding controls picture re-paints) ~60x/s — layered on top of the video
texture the compositor already redraws every frame. On an integrated GPU that
saturates raster.

The patch quantizes the displayed position to `kPositionUiThrottleStep`
(200 ms) via `Duration.floorTo` and skips `setState` when the quantized value is
unchanged, so the controls rebuild at ~5 fps instead of ~60 fps. 200 ms divides
1000 ms evenly, so the `mm:ss` clock text is byte-identical (the floor stays
inside the same whole second); the seek bar fill advances in 200 ms steps, which
is imperceptible and standard for a scrubber. Seeking is untouched — the drag
path uses the pointer-derived `slider`, and the quantized `position` is only the
resting fill. The `if (click)` / `if (tapped)` early-return also drops the
upstream redundant `setState` that fired during a drag (position was ignored
there anyway).

The real-time paths are deliberately left alone: Hibiki's `VideoSubtitleOverlay`,
danmaku overlay and chapter markers read the controller position on their own
(un-throttled) channels, so cue-sync / highlight latency is unchanged. The
black-flicker detector (`VideoBlackFlickerDetector`, TODO-1119) samples mpv frame
counters on its own 1 s timer and is independent of these listeners.

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_position_throttle_test.dart`.

## TODO-1243 follow-up: RepaintBoundary-isolate the seek bar + position clock (large-window iGPU 100%)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material_desktop.dart`
(`MaterialDesktopSeekBarState.build` → `_buildSeekBarBody`,
`MaterialDesktopPositionIndicatorState.build`) and
`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart`
(`MaterialSeekBarState.build` → `_buildSeekBarBody`,
`MaterialPositionIndicatorState.build`).

After the position quantize above, users on integrated GPUs (Intel HD Graphics
620) reported the flicker / 100% GPU **fixed in a small window but still present
maximized / fullscreen**. The throttle cut the repaint *frequency* (which is
window-size-independent), so the remaining cost had to be the per-repaint
*area*, which scales with window size.

Root cause: the seek bar (`MaterialDesktopSeekBar` / `MaterialSeekBar`) and the
`mm:ss` position clock are leaves inside the controls `Stack` that also holds the
two **full-video-area gradient scrim `Container`s** (top + bottom), with **no
`RepaintBoundary`** between them. The seek bar fill still advances every
`kPositionUiThrottleStep` (~5 fps), and `markNeedsPaint` on any leaf propagates
up to the nearest boundary — here the whole full-screen controls picture — so
each fill step re-records **and re-rasterises the entire full-screen controls
picture** (gradients + button bars). Small window = small picture = cheap even
at 5 fps; maximized / fullscreen = full-screen picture re-raster 5×/s on top of
the per-frame video texture composite = HD 620 raster thread pinned.

The fix wraps the seek bar and the position clock each in a `RepaintBoundary`,
so a fill/clock repaint re-rasters only its own thin bounds (a full-width but
~seek-bar-tall strip / a few-char text) instead of the full-screen picture. The
gradient scrims + button bars now paint once and stay cached during steady
playback. This decouples the per-repaint raster cost from window size, so the
large-window case costs the same as the small-window case. Purely a compositor-
layer isolation — no behaviour, geometry, frame rate or seeking change; the
throttle above is unchanged and complementary (it bounds build/relayout
frequency, the boundary bounds raster area).

Source-guard test: `fushi/test/third_party/media_kit_video_seekbar_repaint_boundary_test.dart`.

## BUG-1224: expose the desktop seek-bar push-down as a theme field (`seekBarBottomButtonBarOverlap`)

`MaterialDesktopVideoControls` stacks the bottom chrome as a `Column`
(seek bar, then button bar) anchored to the bottom edge, and pushes the seek bar
**down** with a hard-coded `Transform.translate(offset: Offset(0.0, 16.0))` so
its thin visible track rides on the top edge of the button bar. The seek bar's
clickable area is not the track, though: it is a fully transparent
`seekBarContainerHeight`-tall (default 36) `Container` wrapped in a bare
`Listener`, with the track centred inside it. Net effect: the clickable area
spans `[buttonBarHeight - 16, buttonBarHeight - 16 + 36]` above the video's
bottom edge, i.e. it sticks out **20 logical pixels above the button bar** — and
nothing outside this file could know that, because one number was a constructor
default the host never passed and the other was a literal inside `build()`.

Hibiki draws its own subtitles (`VideoSubtitleOverlay`) above the controls and,
since BUG-838, absorbs pointers that land on a subtitle glyph so a lookup tap is
not stolen by the seek bar's bare `Listener`. With the subtitle's controls-visible
avoidance stopping at `buttonBarHeight`, the subtitle sat exactly on that 20px
band: hovering it still showed the seek preview thumbnail (hover goes through a
non-opaque `MouseRegion`), but pressing there was absorbed by the subtitle and
turned into a dictionary lookup while the seek never fired.

The patch adds `seekBarBottomButtonBarOverlap` (default `16.0`, so the rendered
layout is unchanged) to `MaterialDesktopVideoControlsThemeData` + `copyWith`, and
`Transform.translate` now reads it. Hibiki passes the same constant to the theme
and to `videoSubtitleControlsReserve`, so the controls layout and the subtitle
avoidance are computed from one source instead of two guesses.

## BUG-1485: host-injectable horizontal drag-to-seek mapping (`horizontalSeekResolver`)

`lib/media_kit_video_controls/src/controls/material.dart` — `HorizontalSeekResolver`
typedef, `MaterialVideoControlsThemeData` (+ constructor / `copyWith`), the
`swipeDuration` State field and `onHorizontalDragUpdate` / `onHorizontalDragEnd`.

Upstream maps the mobile horizontal drag-to-seek gesture with
`seconds = dragDx * duration / horizontalGestureSensitivity` (default divisor
1000), i.e. **the seek amount per pixel is proportional to the video's total
duration**. On a 2-hour movie that is 7.2 seconds per logical pixel — a ~400dp
phone screen width spans 48 minutes, so the lightest flick throws the playhead
across half the film (user report: "一拽就起飞"). On a 3-minute clip the very
same formula is far too coarse in the other direction.

The patch:

- adds `typedef HorizontalSeekResolver` (named params: `dragDx`, `surfaceWidth`,
  `duration`, `position`; returns the signed delta) and an optional
  `final HorizontalSeekResolver? horizontalSeekResolver;` theme field;
- `onHorizontalDragUpdate` calls the resolver when non-null and returns early;
  when `null` the upstream formula runs verbatim (including the
  `relativePosition` range check), so pub.dev behaviour is preserved;
- **retypes** the `swipeDuration` State field from `int` (whole seconds) to
  `Duration`, so a resolver can express sub-second deltas — the old whole-second
  quantisation made fine scrubbing impossible. All three read sites
  (`_seekBarDeltaValueNotifier`, `seekIndicatorBuilder`, the built-in fallback
  HUD text) were updated;
- clears `swipeDuration` in `onHorizontalDragEnd`, so a following degenerate drag
  (one that never reaches a second update) cannot re-apply the previous drag's
  delta on release.

`horizontalGestureSensitivity` is left in place and is simply ignored while a
resolver is installed.

Hibiki injects `VideoHorizontalSeekGesture.resolveDelta` (duration-decoupled
"one screen width = N seconds" + power damping + a user-selectable sensitivity
step) through `_mobileControlsTheme` only. The desktop theme has no horizontal
drag gesture at all, so mouse / keyboard seeking is untouched.

## BUG-1644: ANGLE must render on our Direct3D 11 device (`d3d11va` zero-copy)

`windows/angle_surface_manager.{h,cc}` and one log line in `windows/video_output.cc`.

Upstream `ANGLESurfaceManager` creates **two unrelated** Direct3D 11 devices:

- one per `ANGLESurfaceManager` instance, via `D3D11CreateDevice(..., flags = 0)`,
  used only to allocate the two shared BGRA textures Flutter samples;
- one *hidden* device that ANGLE creates for itself, because the `EGLDisplay`
  comes from `eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT(EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_ANGLE,
  EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY, ...)`.

libmpv's `d3d11-egl` hardware-decoding interop
(`mpv/video/out/opengl/hwdec_d3d11egl.c`) has exactly one way to find the device
it must decode into: it reads it back out of the *current* display with
`eglQueryDisplayAttribEXT(EGL_DEVICE_EXT)` →
`eglQueryDeviceAttribEXT(EGL_D3D11_DEVICE_ANGLE)`. So it can only ever see
ANGLE's hidden device — a device nobody created with
`D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_VIDEO_SUPPORT` and nobody marked thread safe (ANGLE hard
codes `debug ? D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_DEBUG : 0`, see ANGLE `Renderer11.cpp`
`callD3D11CreateDevice`). It then hands that device to FFmpeg
(`d3d11_wrap_device_ref` → `d3d11va_device_init`), which `QueryInterface`s for
`ID3D11VideoDevice` **and** `ID3D11VideoContext`. That QI is gated by the flag
at the D3D11 *runtime* level, not by the driver: a device created without
`D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_VIDEO_SUPPORT` returns `E_NOINTERFACE 0x80004002`
(measured on WARP). How much that costs depends on the adapter — measured on a
GeForce RTX 5090 the QI on ANGLE's flag-less device still succeeded — so this
half of the patch is about being correct everywhere rather than about one
machine. When the QI does fail, `init()` returns `-1` and `--hwdec=d3d11va`
degrades to `d3d11va-copy`: every decoded frame is read back to system memory
and re-uploaded to the GPU. Independently observed in `docs/bugs/BUG-1639`
(a separate branch, not merged into `develop` yet)
("`d3d11va` 失败 → `Using hardware decoding (d3d11va-copy)`").

**This patch alone is not sufficient.** `hwdec_d3d11egl::init()` checks
`EGL_EXT_device_query` *before* it ever looks at the device, and libmpv older
than mpv `1d15686142` (2026-07-31) looks for it in the EGL **display**
extension string while ANGLE publishes it in the **client** string — so `init()`
returns `-1` with no log line at all, whichever device the display carries
(measured: `display: no` / `client: YES` on both the upstream
`EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY` and this patch's `EGL_PLATFORM_DEVICE_EXT` display).
`third_party/media_kit_libs_windows_video/windows/CMakeLists.txt` therefore
pins libmpv at or after that fix and documents the floor; the guard test below
enforces it.

The patch does what mpv's own `--gpu-context=angle` does
(`mpv/video/out/opengl/context_angle.c`, `d3d11_device_create`):

- **one** process-wide `ID3D11Device` (`shared_d3d_11_device_`) replaces the
  per-instance ones, created with
  `D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_BGRA_SUPPORT | D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_VIDEO_SUPPORT` and
  marked `ID3D10Multithread::SetMultithreadProtected(TRUE)` (libmpv decodes on
  its own threads while Flutter's raster thread reads the shared texture);
- the `EGLDisplay` is created **on that device** with
  `eglCreateDeviceANGLE(EGL_D3D11_DEVICE_ANGLE, device)` +
  `eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT(EGL_PLATFORM_DEVICE_EXT, ...)`, so
  `EGL_D3D11_DEVICE_ANGLE` resolves to our device and the interop adopts it;
- `CleanUp(true)` no longer `Release`s the device per instance (that would free
  it under the surviving `VideoOutput`s) — the last instance calls
  `ReleaseSharedResources()`, which terminates the display, releases the
  `EGLDeviceEXT` and only then the device.

Every new step is guarded: if the device rejects the flags they are dropped one
by one, and if `eglCreateDeviceANGLE` / the device-backed display is
unavailable the original
`EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_ANGLE`/`EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY` four-candidate fallback chain
(D3D11 → D3D11 9_3 → D3D9 → wrap) runs verbatim, so machines that cannot take
the new path behave exactly like pub.dev.

`ANGLESurfaceManager::uses_shared_d3d11_device()` makes the outcome observable;
`VideoOutput` logs `libmpv d3d11-egl zero-copy interop: available/unavailable`
next to its existing `Using H/W rendering.` line.

## BUG-1657: a failed interop surface must not cost the whole GPU pipeline

`windows/angle_surface_manager.{h,cc}` and one log line in `windows/video_output.cc`.

BUG-1644 added a new display type (`EGL_PLATFORM_DEVICE_EXT` on our own D3D11
device). `EnsureSharedEGLDisplay()` falls back to the upstream
`EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY` chain only when creating *that display* fails, but the
config, the context and the `eglCreatePbufferFromClientBuffer` all happen
afterwards, and any of those failing threw straight out of `Create()`, which
drops the whole `VideoOutput` into `MPV_RENDER_API_TYPE_SW`.

That downgrade is far more expensive than it looks: the software path is not
`vo=gpu`, so libmpv's `glsl-shaders` (Anime4K & other upscalers) and the
`scale`/`cscale` filters stop applying **silently**. Measured with one user's
real shader set, same libmpv, same clip, changing only the render API: the
generated shaders contain 2016 `conv2d` references on the GL path and **zero**
on the S/W path. The user-visible symptom is just "super-resolution stopped
working", with nothing in any log.

Note on evidence: mpv never emits a user shader's `//!DESC` text into the
generated shader or the log, so "the log does not mention Anime4K" proves
nothing. The reliable marker is the intermediate texture names a shader
declares with `//!SAVE` (`conv2d*` here), which do appear in the generated
GLSL/HLSL.

The patch:

- `Create()` calls `RetryOnUpstreamEGLDisplay()` when `CreateAndBindEGLSurface()`
  fails. It terminates the device-backed display, releases the `EGLDeviceEXT`,
  latches `shared_interop_display_disabled_` so neither this nor a later
  instance rebuilds it, and rebuilds context + surface on the upstream display.
  Only then, if that also fails, does it throw. Guarded by `instance_count_ == 0`
  so a shared display another `VideoOutput` is already rendering on is never
  torn down.
- `VideoOutput` logs, next to `Using S/W rendering.`, that
  `libmpv glsl-shaders & scale filters are INERT`, so the next such report is
  diagnosable from the log alone.

Net effect: a problem that only affects zero-copy now costs only zero-copy,
instead of costing hardware rendering and every shader with it.
