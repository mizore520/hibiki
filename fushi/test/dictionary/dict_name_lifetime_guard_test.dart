// BUG-051 source-scan guard.
//
// Root cause: `Index::title` (yomitan_parser.hpp) is a `std::string_view` that
// glaze parses zero-copy — it only points into the JSON source buffer while
// that buffer is alive. `DictionaryQuery::add_dict` (query.cpp) used to read
// `index.title` AFTER the `index_buf` block had closed, i.e. after the buffer
// was freed. That use-after-free left the copied `dict.name` with its leading
// bytes overwritten by recycled heap data, so dictionary labels in the popup
// rendered as U+FFFD garble (heap-layout dependent → intermittent).
//
// This guard fails if anyone reintroduces the bug by reading `index.title`
// outside the `index_buf` scope. It works on the relative brace depth between
// the `index_buf` declaration and every `index.title` usage: a usage that has
// left the buffer's block (net depth < 0) is a use-after-free.
//
// Layer rationale: the fix lives in native C++ that flutter_test cannot link,
// so the strongest *landable* automated guard is a source-scan over the C++ —
// same approach the repo uses for other invariants. A manual end-to-end check
// also exists at native/fushidicts/tests/dict_name_lifetime_test.cpp.
