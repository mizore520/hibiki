// BUG-486 / TODO-1034: importing an audiobook (m4b + same-name epub) where the
// epub has no cover and the cover must come from the m4b's embedded artwork.
// The embedded-cover extraction (`extractEmbeddedCover` -> ffmpeg probe on
// desktop) is async with hundreds-of-ms to multi-second latency. If the user
// taps "Import" before the probe returns, the import path read `_audioCoverPath`
// while it was still null and silently dropped the cover; restarting the app
// re-imported with the m4b already disk-cached so the probe returned instantly
// and the cover came back -- the tell-tale of an import-time race, not a render
// staleness bug.
//
// Fix: `_tryExtractAudioCover()` stores its in-flight Future in
// `_coverExtraction`, and `_applyBestCoverToEpub` awaits that Future (zero wait
// if already done) before reading `_audioCoverPath`.
//
// Test 1 (behavioral) models the exact ordering contract: an extraction Future
// that resolves the cover only after a delay; awaiting it before the read must
// observe the non-null cover. Reverting the await (reading before the Future
// completes) makes this red.
//
// Test 2 (source guard) pins that `_applyBestCoverToEpub` actually awaits
// `_coverExtraction` ahead of the `_audioCoverPath` branch in production code.
