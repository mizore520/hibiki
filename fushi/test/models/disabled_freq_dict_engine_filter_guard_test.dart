// BUG-178 source-scan guard.
//
// Root cause: a frequency / pitch dictionary that the user "disabled" in the
// dictionary manager (the visibility Switch toggles `Dictionary.hiddenLanguages`
// via `toggleDictionaryHidden`) was STILL loaded into the native fushidicts FFI
// engine, so its frequency/pitch data kept appearing in the lookup popup. Unlike
// term glossaries (filtered at render time by `dictionaryNamesByHidden`, or never
// loaded for a hidden dict), frequency/pitch values come straight from
// `lookupPopupJson` (the C++ engine), whose freq/pitch indexes are loaded in
// `_rebuildDictPathsCache` / `_rebuildDictPathsCacheAsync`. Those two methods
// collected freqPaths/pitchPaths from EVERY dictionary of the matching type
// without ever checking `isHidden(...)`, so a disabled frequency dictionary was
// loaded and its values surfaced anyway.
//
// Fix: skip dictionaries that are hidden for the target language when collecting
// freqPaths/pitchPaths, so a disabled frequency/pitch dictionary never enters the
// engine. And clear the dictionary result cache on `toggleDictionaryHidden`, so a
// previously cached popupJson (built while the dict was still enabled) does not
// keep resurfacing the now-disabled dictionary's values until the next cold query.
//
// Layer rationale: the real reload happens through a C++ FFI engine flutter_test
// cannot link, and these are `AppModel` members wired to the live Drift DB +
// filesystem + FFI. The strongest *landable* automated guard is a source scan
// over `app_model.dart` asserting the control-flow invariants the bug violated.
// A real-device pass (disable a frequency dict, then look a word up without
// restarting and confirm the frequency tag is gone) is still required.
