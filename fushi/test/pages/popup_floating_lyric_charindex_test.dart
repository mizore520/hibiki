/// Behaviour test for the Dart half of the BUG-214 fix: the popup must segment
/// the *tapped* word from the supplied charIndex, instead of always searching
/// from the sentence head.
///
/// popup_main._extractWord delegates the actual segmentation to
/// [JapaneseLanguage.wordFromIndex]. The C++ FFI segmenter (FushiDicts) is not
/// available on the Dart test host, so wordFromIndex runs in its documented
/// degraded mode where it returns the single tapped character. That degraded
/// path is exactly what proves the regression contract: the *index* is the
/// anchor that decides where the word is cut.
///
/// Before the fix the Android native popup discarded charIndex entirely and
/// fed FushiDicts the whole sentence, so its longest-match always started at
/// offset 0 ("点哪都查句首"). These assertions pin that wordFromIndex actually
/// consumes the index — different indices yield different anchors, and the
/// out-of-range / negative sentinel falls back to "no per-character word"
/// (which _extractWord maps to a whole-sentence search, matching the system
/// PROCESS_TEXT path).
