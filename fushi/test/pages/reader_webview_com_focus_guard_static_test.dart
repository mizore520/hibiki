/// BUG-019 — opening an audiobook-attached book on Windows rendered a permanent
/// blank reader. media_kit/libmpv (loaded when the audiobook plays) can leave
/// the platform thread's COM uninitialized, so WebView2's
/// `CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions` fails with CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED and
/// the reader never paints. The fork must call `CoInitializeEx` (idempotent,
/// refcounted) right before creating the environment so the precondition holds
/// regardless of what other plugins did to global COM state.
///
/// (The former BUG-020 sub-guard — "every `_chromeFocusScope.nextFocus()` must
/// be context-guarded" — was removed in TODO-700 T8: the bottom chrome bar is
/// now wrapped in `ExcludeFocus` and no longer traversed, so the reader no
/// longer calls `_chromeFocusScope.nextFocus()` at all and the unattached-scope
/// crash path is gone at the root. The "no dead chrome-focus traversal" contract
/// is now held by reader_caret_down_paginates_test.dart.)
