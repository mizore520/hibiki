/// An `InAppWebView` *widget* owns its `InAppWebViewController` and disposes it
/// during the widget's own unmount. Application `State` code must therefore
/// NEVER call `_controller.dispose()` itself — that is a double dispose. It is a
/// harmless no-op on Android/iOS/macOS, but a hard FlutterError on the Windows
/// fork, whose `disposeChannel()` asserts the channel isn't already disposed
/// ("WindowsInAppWebViewController was used after being disposed"), thrown
/// during widget-tree finalization when the view closes.
///
/// In every one of these files the webview controller is the field named
/// `_controller`. Other disposes in the same files (e.g. the reader's
/// `controller.dispose()` for AudiobookPlayerController, or
/// `_audiobookController?.dispose()`) are NOT the webview controller and are
/// fine. A real behavioral test would need a live WebView2 native layer, so we
/// lock the contract at the source level across all `InAppWebView` widget sites.
///
/// `HeadlessInAppWebView` is the opposite case: it has no widget, so it MUST be
/// disposed manually — those sites are intentionally excluded here.
