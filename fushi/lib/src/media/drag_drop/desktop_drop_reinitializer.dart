/// Restores desktop_drop's OS-level drag-and-drop registration on Windows after
/// it has been usurped by a WebView2 controller (TODO-1275 / BUG-361).
///
/// Root cause: on Windows, opening a reader/video/lookup WebView2 makes the
/// WebView2 runtime register its own `IDropTarget` on the host window (default
/// `AllowExternalDrop=TRUE`), evicting the one `desktop_drop` registered once at
/// startup. When the controller is torn down — or when the fork sets
/// `put_AllowExternalDrop(FALSE)` after the fact — WebView2 revokes its target
/// WITHOUT restoring desktop_drop's, leaving the host window with no valid
/// `IDropTarget`. Drag-import then shows the "forbidden" cursor app-wide until
/// the app restarts. `put_AllowExternalDrop(FALSE)` alone cannot fix this
/// because it runs after the controller already hijacked the registration, and
/// desktop_drop's OS registration is a one-time C++ call that Dart cannot
/// otherwise re-trigger.
///
/// The vendored fork of `desktop_drop` (see
/// `third_party/desktop_drop/windows/desktop_drop_plugin.cpp`) adds a
/// `reinitialize` method that re-runs `RevokeDragDrop` + `RegisterDragDrop`.
/// [reinitialize] invokes it after media closes, restoring drag-import
/// regardless of which controller usurped the window.
