/// percentage is dishonest because the per-phase totals aren't known until each
/// phase lists its remote side, so progress is reported PER PHASE: each phase
/// knows its item count up front, and large-file transfers blend their
/// byte-level fraction into the current item. This mirrors the determinate bar
/// the compare dialog already shows on Apply.
