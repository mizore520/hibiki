/// Pure, side-effect-free merge semantics for the aggregate families that
/// travel between devices on both offline backup merge-import (TODO-888) and
/// online two-way sync (TODO-1056 phase B/C). "Aggregate" means the families
/// whose merge is a value fold rather than a relational id-remap:
///
/// - per-bucket statistics (reading / video / hourly): MAX-union
/// - per-bucket mining counts: MAX (never SUM)
/// - mined-sentence history: fingerprint dedupe-union
/// - favorite words: uniqueKey dedupe-union
/// - favorite SENTENCES (a preference JSON blob): content dedupe-union
///
/// Every operation obeys the same four invariants, exactly the guarantees
/// online sync needs so a re-sync of the same snapshot is a no-op:
///
/// 1. Only-grows: a merged bucket/collection never loses a key the local side
///    had. Deletions are NOT propagated across the edge (a device that deleted
///    a favorite must not resurrect it on the peer, but a peer's favorite the
///    device never had is added).
/// 2. Never-shrinks-a-value: a numeric bucket only ever moves UP (max), never
///    down. A device that under-counts a bucket cannot pull the peer down.
/// 3. Idempotent: merge(a, a) == a and merge(merge(a, b), b) == merge(a, b).
///    Re-importing / re-syncing the same peer snapshot changes nothing.
/// 4. Commutative on the union set: which side is local vs remote does not
///    change the resulting set of buckets/rows or the per-bucket MAX. (For the
///    collections that keep the "earliest wins" tie-break the retained payload
///    on a content collision is order-independent: it is the row with the
///    smaller createdAt.)
///
/// This class is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for these semantics. The offline
/// backup path (BackupMergeEngine) delegates its favorite-sentence pref-blob
/// merge here (there is no other implementation of it), and its SQL MAX-union /
/// dedupe-union statements are the relational projection of the pure folds
/// defined here. The pure functions are what the online sync path (phase B/C)
/// will call directly on materialised snapshots, and the tests pin both paths
/// to the identical contract.
///
/// All members are static; the class holds no state and is never instantiated.
