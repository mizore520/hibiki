/// context. On a *pure-display* page (e.g. reading statistics) there is nothing
/// focusable in the body, so focus rests on the single top-level
/// [FushiFocusRoot] fallback node — which lives ABOVE every route, i.e. above
/// the page scaffold's [PrimaryScrollController]. `maybeOf` only walks
/// ancestors, so it can never reach a controller that sits *below* the focus.
///
/// Pages push their scroll controller here on mount and pop it on dispose; the
/// top of the stack is the visible route's controller, reachable regardless of
/// where focus currently sits in the tree.
