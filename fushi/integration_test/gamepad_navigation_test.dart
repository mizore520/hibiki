/// Real-device verification of the universal gamepad/keyboard navigation layer
/// on the HOME surface (no WebView involved — the only emulator available
/// crashes its WebView renderer, see docs/REGRESSION_BUGS.md HBK #1).
///
/// Proves, on the real Android Flutter engine, that:
///   1. directional keys (D-pad maps to arrow logical keys) move focus among
///      the real home widgets — i.e. the UI is traversable without taps;
///   2. gameButtonB pops a pushed route via the global FushiPopIntent.
///
/// gameButtonA activation is covered device-independently by
/// test/shortcuts/gamepad_navigation_flow_test.dart and
/// test/widgets/fushi_focusable_test.dart.
///
/// STATUS (2026-05-29): mechanism verified by the two widget tests above (real
/// Flutter key pipeline). This `flutter drive` run is the device path and uses
/// in-engine `WidgetTester.sendKeyEvent` — the ONLY reliable way to drive the
/// Flutter focus system. Note: raw `adb shell input keyevent` was empirically
/// found NOT to drive this Flutter app on emulator-5556 (DPAD/Tab/Back produced
/// no focus change despite the app holding window focus), matching the repo
/// testing architecture (UI interaction goes through `flutter drive`, not adb).
/// Device runs here were also slowed by cold Windows builds; the test itself is
/// expected to pass on a stable tree.
///
/// Run:
///   flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
///       --target=integration_test/gamepad_navigation_test.dart
