# TODO-705: Publish a mirror update manifest (latest-<channel>.json) to the
# `update-manifest` orphan branch so beta/debug update checks succeed inside
# China (raw.githubusercontent.com is reachable through public gh proxies; the
# api.github.com /releases list is 403'd through every mirror, see BUG-292).
#
# This is a DATA FILE pushed to a git branch, NOT a GitHub Release. It must
# never promote a Latest release / prerelease:false and never call the release
# the release-channel hard rules (CLAUDE.md) say push events only produce
# debug/prerelease/non-Latest artifacts, and `update-manifest` is intentionally
# absent from both release workflows' push trigger branch lists (main/develop
# only), so writing it never cascades a new workflow run.
#
# Required env:
#   CHANNEL           release channel (debug|beta|formal|github-release)
#   TAG               VERSION tag written into the manifest's `tag` field, e.g.
#                     v0.10.1-beta.162 / v0.10.1-debug.5633+3cf5905. The client
#                     compares THIS to decide "is there a newer build?", so it
#                     must keep the versioned/seq shape even when the debug
#                     channel reuses a single rolling GitHub Release (TODO-1049).
#   DOWNLOAD_TAG      git tag the assets actually live under on GitHub, used ONLY
#                     to form browser_download_url = releases/download/<tag>/...
#                     Defaults to TAG (beta/formal: the release IS the version
#                     tag). The debug channel sets it to the fixed rolling tag
#                     `debug-rolling`, so one GitHub Release entry is reused
#                     forever (no per-push prerelease pile-up) while the
#                     manifest's `tag` still advances by seq (TODO-1049).
#   PRERELEASE        true|false  (echoed verbatim from steps.channel outputs)
#   NOTES             release notes / body
#   RELEASE_SEQUENCE  monotonic git rev-list count (NOT a workflow run-number)
#   VERSION           normalized version (build_version_name)
#   REPO              owner/repo, e.g. hajisensai/Fushi
#   GITHUB_TOKEN      token with contents:write on REPO
#   ARTIFACTS_DIR     dir holding the built release assets for THIS platform
#   ASSET_GLOB        glob (relative to ARTIFACTS_DIR) of this platform's assets
#   PLATFORM_LABEL    short label for the commit message (android|desktop)

# Map (product family, channel) -> manifest filename. Only managed channels get
# a manifest; github-release events publish through the Release UI directly and

#
# BUG-1481: the filename MUST carry the product family, not just the channel.
# Two products ship out of this ONE repo during the Hibiki->Fushi rename --
# `app.hibiki.reader` (the migration bridge, built from the bridge branch) and
# `app.fushi.reader` (here). One repo means one `update-manifest` branch, so
# keying the file on channel alone made both families write the SAME file.
# merge_update_manifest.py's monotonic seq guard (TODO-1173) then handed the
# advertised top-level release to whichever family had the higher commit count,
# permanently: the other family's clients read a version/tag/assets that are not
# theirs and can never self-update. Splitting the filename is what makes the two
# release streams independent -- it also degrades the guard and the rolling-tag
# prune back to the single-product case they were designed for.
#
# The historical names (`latest-<channel>.json`) belong to the HIBIKI family and
# are FROZEN: Hibiki clients already in the wild (v1.2.0 and older) have that
# exact URL compiled in and cannot be patched. Fushi has never shipped a
# stable/beta release, so it is Fushi that moves to the suffixed names.
# `fushi/test/tools/update_manifest_product_split_test.dart` pins this suffix
# against the client-side constants in update_checker_release.dart.

# BUG-1516 ①b: the DESKTOP half of this run also has to reach the retired

#
# BUG-1481 split the manifest per product family so Android never gets handed a
# cross-package APK -- it literally cannot install one
# (INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE). Correct for Android. Desktop needs the
# exact opposite: `platform_updater.dart` keeps ReleaseProduct.any on
# Windows/macOS on purpose ("桌面不做这层提升……Phase 5 有意如此") because there
# the package rename is carried by the installer overwriting in place. A Hibiki
# Windows client selecting `fushi-*-windows-setup.exe` and installing it IS the
# desktop migration -- there is no desktop bridge (MigrationPage is Android-only).
#
# Splitting per FILE therefore cut the desktop migration path: latest-debug.json
# stopped receiving Fushi assets, its Windows slot froze on the pre-split build,
# and the rolling prune later deleted that file (the reported 404). Mirror the
# desktop assets back in -- assets only, never the top level, which stays the
