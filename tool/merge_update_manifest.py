"""Merge one platform release assets into the update-manifest JSON file.

TODO-781 (race) + TODO-1173 (version downgrade). Two problems break a naive
merge of the manifest that publish_update_manifest.sh pushes to the
update-manifest branch:

  1. Two platform publish jobs (android / desktop) push the SAME branch
     concurrently for the SAME release tag; the losing job assets get
     clobbered. Fixed by preserving the OTHER platform assets.
  2. Each platform job stamps the manifest with its OWN commit git rev-list
     count sequence. A slow platform build (Windows) from an OLDER push can
     finish AFTER a newer push fast platform job. The prior logic only
     compared existing.tag == tag: a different tag caused a FULL overwrite,
     so the slow-old job wrote its OLDER version back over the manifest and
     clients on the newer build saw an older latest, reporting
     already-up-to-date (the version downgrade of TODO-1173).

The fix is a MONOTONIC, PER-PLATFORM merge keyed on releaseSequence:

  * Monotonic guard: the advertised top-level tag/version/releaseSequence
    never moves backward. If the manifest already carries a HIGHER
    releaseSequence than this run, this run keeps the existing (newer)
    top-level metadata and only contributes assets for its own platform.
  * Cross-platform asset union: assets are grouped by platform (from the
    asset name shape). Each platform keeps the asset set from its OWN
    highest sequence. A late older-sequence job only refreshes its own
    platform slot (and only if its sequence is not lower than what that
    slot already holds); it NEVER wipes another platform newer assets. A
    late older SAME-platform job is rejected. This keeps a lagging platform
    asset present so the client selectUpdateReleaseForCurrentPlatform never
    returns null.
  * Liveness filter (BUG-1516): "keep the lagging platform's asset" is only
    safe while that asset still EXISTS. The rolling release prunes old
    assets per platform, so a platform that stops publishing eventually has
    its retained entry point at a deleted file -- the client then downloads
    a hard 404 with no in-app recovery (real report: an old Hibiki debug
    client stuck on hibiki-1.3.2-debug.10182-windows-setup.exe after that
    asset was pruned, while the manifest advertised 1.3.3-debug.10192 up
    top). Retained entries are therefore intersected with the release's
    CURRENT asset names when the caller can supply them. Dropping the slot
    makes the client report "no build for your platform" instead of a
    broken download -- an honest miss beats a guaranteed 404.

releaseSequence used to be write-only; it is now the primary comparison key
and is persisted PER ASSET so a later merge can compare platforms sitting at
different sequences. Legacy manifests without the field degrade safely: the
sequence is recovered from the tag (...-debug.5633+sha -> 5633), then from
the top-level releaseSequence, and finally treated as unknown/oldest so a
fresh publish supersedes it. The extra per-asset keys are ignored by the
client (buildReleaseFromManifest reads only name + browser_download_url).

Reading/writing a file (not a git tree) keeps this offline-testable:
fushi/test/tools/update_manifest_publish_race_test.dart drives this script
twice over one file, and tool/merge_update_manifest_test.py unit-tests
merge_manifest() directly.

Required env:
  MANIFEST_FILE        path to the manifest JSON to read/merge/write
  TAG                  this release tag (v0.11.1-debug.5633+3cf5905)
  CHANNEL              debug|beta|formal
  VERSION              normalized version string
  PRERELEASE           true|false
  NOTES                release notes
  RELEASE_SEQUENCE     monotonic int (git rev-list count)
  PLATFORM_ASSETS_JSON JSON array of {name, browser_download_url} for THIS run

Optional env:
  LIVE_ASSET_NAMES_JSON  JSON array of asset names that STILL EXIST on the
                         rolling release right now (BUG-1516). Retained
                         entries whose file has been pruned are dropped.
                         Absent / empty / unparseable => no filtering, so a
                         failed `gh release view` can never wipe the manifest.
