/// Source-scan guards for TODO-959 / BUG-476 (迁移重启新进程冷启动黑屏).
///
/// The data-root migration restarts the app: a detached new process is started
/// with `--fushi-restarted` and the old process calls `exit(0)`. Between the
/// old process exiting and the new process drawing its first Flutter frame
/// there used to be a black/undefined window:
///   1. The runner window class had `hbrBackground = 0` (no background brush)
///      yet was created `WS_VISIBLE`, so the empty window painted black.
///   2. The Dart `--fushi-restarted` branch only grabbed foreground, never
///      changing those black pixels.
///
/// The fix is two-pronged and native, so it cannot run on the Dart host:
///   - Direction 1: give the window class a non-black splash brush.
///   - Direction 2: the restarted process creates its window hidden (no
///     WS_VISIBLE) and Dart shows it after the first frame, with a fallback
///     show in catch so it can never stay permanently invisible.
///
/// These guards pin that load-bearing wiring; a refactor that silently drops
/// any of it would re-introduce the cold-start black window.
