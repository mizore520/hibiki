  // SAME layout pass, it is deactivated (still mounted, but inactive) and not
  // yet unregistered. register()'s synchronous _handleFocusChange() then walked
  // that inactive entry and called ModalRoute.of() on its deactivated context —
  // an ancestor lookup the framework forbids ("Looking up a deactivated
  // widget's ancestor is unsafe" / markNeedsBuild during build). Focus
  // recomputation must be deferred to the post-frame repair, never run
