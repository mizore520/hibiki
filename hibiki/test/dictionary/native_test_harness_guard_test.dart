/// TODO-578 fast (source-scan) gate of the native hoshidicts test layer.
///
/// The deep gate is the native ctest suite itself (only runnable where a C++23
/// toolchain is present). This Dart test runs in `flutter test` everywhere and
/// guards that the harness + CI wiring stay in place so the deep gate can never
/// silently fall out of CI:
///   * tests/CMakeLists.txt aggregates every native test into ctest;
///   * each P0/P1/P2 e2e source file exists;
///   * the Linux CI job actually builds + runs the suite via ctest;
///   * the existing macOS ctypes create/destroy dylib smoke is NOT touched
///     (so the deep-gate addition is not mistaken for a regression of it).
