# 2026-05-19 Project Review

## Round 1: Windows Home Layout

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/hoshi_settings_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/history_reader_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-010
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/hoshi_settings_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/history_reader_page.dart`
- root cause: Windows/desktop home layout had a `NavigationRail`, but each content surface owned its own width and grid rules. Dictionary used a local 960px cap, settings used a too-narrow 640px cap, and reader history duplicated shelf-card breakpoints.
- impact: the default Windows window could still feel like a stretched phone layout, and future desktop UI changes would drift because the layout policy was scattered across page implementations.
- fix: introduced shared desktop layout metrics and `DesktopContentLayout`; reader shelf, dictionary, and settings now share the same content-width and padding policy, and shelf card extents are computed from one function.
- verification: `flutter test test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart` passed, then `flutter test` passed with 730 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` also completed and produced `build/windows/x64/runner/Debug/hibiki.exe`; the build emitted existing CMake/WebView2/native conversion warnings but no errors. This is a code-path/layout-policy and Windows compile verification; full Windows runtime screenshot review is still a separate manual QA step.

### Next Scope
- If time permits, launch the Windows build and capture screenshots of Books, Dictionaries, and Settings at the default `1280x720` runner size.

## Round 2: Windows UI Verification Path

### Scope
- `hibiki/integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart`
- Windows desktop UI interaction verification for the home navigation rail.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-011
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart`
- root cause: the app smoke integration test only looked for `BottomNavigationBar` and Material `NavigationBar`. On Windows the home page uses `NavigationRail`, so the test could start the app but skip the actual desktop tab-switching path.
- impact: Windows Books -> Dictionaries -> Books navigation could regress without this smoke test noticing. Manual screenshots are also a weak source of truth here because external window capture can lie about the real Flutter layout under DPI, occlusion, or compositor state.
- fix: the smoke test now resolves primary navigation targets from `NavigationRail`, `BottomNavigationBar`, or `NavigationBar`, then taps the Flutter widgets through the integration test framework.
- verification: `flutter drive -d windows --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart` passed from `hibiki/`. This uses Flutter test interaction, not host mouse input. The earlier external `PrintWindow` screenshot was treated as invalid evidence after local visual disagreement and was not used as a basis for UI changes.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with `flutter drive` coverage for CJK dictionary search and Hoshi reader interactions, using fixtures where required.

## Round 3: Windows Integration Test Targeting

### Scope
- `hibiki/integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/user_path_test.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/reader_dictionary_test.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/regression_test.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`
- `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-012
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/user_path_test.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/reader_dictionary_test.dart`, `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- root cause: integration tests selected navigation tabs by scanning the whole widget tree for icons such as `Icons.search`. On Windows the content area can contain the same icons as the navigation rail, so the tests could tap a content icon instead of the navigation target.
- impact: Windows UI drive tests could become flaky or silently exercise the wrong path, especially around Dictionary and Settings navigation.
- fix: introduced a shared `findPrimaryNavigationTargets()` helper that scopes icon lookup to `NavigationRail`, `BottomNavigationBar`, or `NavigationBar`; app smoke, user path, and reader/dictionary integration tests now use that helper.
- verification: `flutter test test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart` passed and validates that content-area search icons are ignored when a `NavigationRail` is present. `flutter test` also passed with 731 tests, and `flutter drive -d windows --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_smoke_test.dart` passed after the helper was shared.

#### HBK-AUDIT-013
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/user_path_test.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/reader_dictionary_test.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/regression_test.dart`
- root cause: Windows desktop `flutter drive` reports `MissingPluginException` for `integration_test` screenshot capture, but the tests still required at least one screenshot.
- impact: completed Windows widget interactions could fail only because screenshot capture is unsupported in this drive path.
- fix: screenshot evidence remains required on platforms that support it, but Windows drive tests now use widget assertions and drive exit status as the authoritative evidence.
- verification: `flutter drive -d windows --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/user_path_test.dart` reached all tab navigation steps and skipped screenshots correctly; a later run was interrupted by a Flutter Windows `RawKeyboard` assertion caused by a host `Meta Left` key event while the user was actively using the machine, so this test remains environment-sensitive rather than a product UI failure. The non-focus-stealing validation path is covered by `flutter test test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart` and the passing Windows `app_smoke_test` drive run above.

### Next Scope
- Continue with non-focus-stealing Windows checks first. For full `user_path_test` and reader/dictionary drive validation, run when the desktop keyboard focus is not being used, or move those flows to widget-level tests where possible.

## Round 4: Reader Shelf Grid Width

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/history_reader_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-014
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/history_reader_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- root cause: reader shelf grid card extents were computed from `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width`, i.e. the whole app/window width. On Windows the shelf is inside `DesktopContentLayout`, so the grid's real content width can be much narrower than the full window.
- impact: on wide Windows layouts the shelf could pick a wider card breakpoint than the constrained grid actually has, causing inconsistent columns and spacing drift between EPUB and SRT sections.
- fix: added `readerShelfGridExtentForLayout()` and changed the base reader shelf plus Hoshi EPUB/SRT grids to compute extents from `LayoutBuilder` constraints, falling back to media width only when no content constraint is available.
- verification: `flutter test test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart` passed and now covers constrained content width (`mediaWidth: 1600`, `contentWidth: 760` -> `180`).

### Next Scope
- Continue auditing Windows-specific focus/keyboard behavior without using host mouse input; current remaining blocker is full drive validation while the desktop keyboard is actively in use.

## Round 5: Non-Focus-Stealing Navigation Evidence

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`
- `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-015
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- root cause: full Windows `flutter drive` can receive host keyboard messages while the user is actively using the same desktop. The observed failure happened in Flutter's Windows `RawKeyboard` platform message path for a host `Meta Left` key event before Hibiki's `HomePage._handleKeyEvent` or `ReaderHoshiPage._handleKeyEvent` business logic could decide anything.
- impact: a valid Windows UI interaction test can fail because the test window briefly owns focus while unrelated host keyboard input is present. Re-running this while the user is working would violate the no-mouse/no-focus-stealing constraint and still give noisy evidence.
- fix: expanded the no-window widget coverage for the shared integration helper. The test now proves that desktop `NavigationRail` order is stable (`Books`, `Dictionary`, `Settings`), content-area icons are ignored, mobile bottom navigation remains supported, and Windows drive screenshot capture is optional.
- verification: `flutter test test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart` passed with 4 tests. This does not replace full reader/dictionary drive validation, but it removes the focus-stealing dependency from the navigation/screenshot portions of the Windows UI evidence.

### Next Scope
- Continue moving reader/dictionary interaction checks toward widget or lower-level Hoshi JS/CSS tests where possible. Full Windows drive should only run when the desktop is idle enough that host keyboard events will not contaminate Flutter's platform input stream.

## Round 6: Desktop Layout Constraint Evidence

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- Windows layout evidence path after the user reported the external screenshot did not match the live app.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-016
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- root cause: the previous external screenshot path was not reliable enough to judge the Windows UI. It could disagree with the user's live view, so it should not be treated as product evidence. The shared desktop layout policy also only had pure metric tests, not a widget-level check that Flutter's real constraint tree produced the intended content width.
- impact: a false screenshot could waste review time, and a future change to `DesktopContentLayout` could silently remove the desktop width cap or compact full-width behavior without failing tests.
- fix: added widget tests for `DesktopContentLayout` that run without opening a desktop window. The tests verify expanded dictionary content is capped to the 1040px desktop policy minus 24px side padding, and compact content remains full-width without desktop padding.
- verification: `flutter test test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart` passed with 9 tests. `dart format .` completed with 0 changed files. `flutter test` passed with 737 tests. No Windows runner was launched, so this round did not take desktop focus from the user.

### Next Scope
- Continue non-focus-stealing review of Hoshi reader and dictionary interaction contracts. Treat external screenshots as supporting artifacts only when they agree with widget/DOM/bounds evidence.

## Round 7: Reader Keyboard Navigation Contract

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/reader/reader_pagination_scripts.dart`
- `hibiki/test/reader/reader_pagination_scripts_test.dart`

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-017
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/reader/reader_pagination_scripts.dart`, `hibiki/test/reader/reader_pagination_scripts_test.dart`
- root cause: Windows/desktop reader keyboard navigation was only encoded inside the private `ReaderHoshiPage._handleKeyEvent()` method. Proving PageDown/arrow-key behavior therefore required launching the full reader/WebView path, which is focus-sensitive on Windows and unsuitable while the user is actively using the desktop.
- impact: reader keyboard paging could regress silently, or review could fall back to noisy full-window drive runs that may be contaminated by host keyboard events.
- fix: extracted the key-to-`ReaderNavigationDirection` mapping into `ReaderPaginationScripts.navigationDirectionForKey()`. `ReaderHoshiPage._handleKeyEvent()` now delegates to the shared mapping, and unit tests cover forward keys, backward keys, and ignored non-navigation keys.
- verification: TDD red check failed as expected because `ReaderPaginationScripts.navigationDirectionForKey` did not exist. After the extraction, `flutter test test/reader/reader_pagination_scripts_test.dart` passed with 28 tests. `dart format .` formatted the two changed Dart files. `flutter test` passed with 740 tests. No Windows runner was launched, so this round did not take desktop focus from the user.

### Next Scope
- Continue checking reader/dictionary interaction contracts that can be moved out of full Windows drive runs. Prioritize pure functions or widget tests for focus-sensitive paths.

## Round 8: Dictionary Search Field Targeting

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`
- `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- Windows/CJK dictionary search drive-test targeting.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-018
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`, `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- root cause: `findSearchField()` selected the first `TextField`/`TextFormField` in the entire widget tree. On Windows desktop layouts the dictionary tab can coexist with other content or overlay input fields, so the CJK dictionary drive test could type into an unrelated field instead of the real home dictionary search field.
- impact: Windows CJK search validation could become flaky or silently verify the wrong input target, leaving the actual dictionary search path untested.
- fix: gave the home dictionary search `TextField` a stable `ValueKey<String>('home_dictionary_search_field')`, and changed `findSearchField()` to prefer that keyed field before falling back to the old generic field lookup for compatibility.
- verification: TDD red check failed as expected because `findSearchField()` picked `unrelated_search_field`. After the fix, `flutter test test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart` passed with 5 tests. `dart format .` formatted the changed dictionary page. `flutter test` passed with 741 tests. No Windows runner was launched, so this round did not take desktop focus from the user.

### Next Scope
- Continue reducing full Windows drive dependency by giving reader/dictionary interaction targets stable keys and lower-level tests where possible.

## Round 9: Dictionary Result Evidence

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/reader_dictionary_test.dart`
- `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- Windows/CJK dictionary search result verification.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-019
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/home_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/reader_dictionary_test.dart`, `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- root cause: `reader_dictionary_test` treated any `Card`, `ListTile`, or `ExpansionTile` in the full widget tree as dictionary search result evidence. On desktop layouts this is too broad: unrelated settings rows, history cards, or overlay widgets can satisfy the count without proving that the CJK dictionary result view actually appeared.
- impact: Windows CJK dictionary search drive validation could produce a false pass while the actual result pane failed to render.
- fix: added a stable `ValueKey<String>('home_dictionary_result_evidence')` inside the home dictionary result view, exposed `findDictionaryResultEvidence()`, and changed `reader_dictionary_test` to assert that keyed evidence instead of counting unrelated generic widgets.
- verification: TDD red check failed as expected because `findDictionaryResultEvidence()` did not exist. After the fix, `flutter test test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart` passed with 6 tests. `dart format .` formatted the changed dictionary page. `flutter test` passed with 742 tests. No Windows runner was launched, so this round did not take desktop focus from the user.

### Next Scope
- Continue hardening Windows reader/dictionary drive assertions so every check proves a specific app surface instead of relying on generic widget counts.

## Round 10: Home Readiness Targeting

### Scope
- `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`
- `hibiki/integration_test/user_path_test.dart`
- `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- Windows drive startup readiness checks.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-020
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/integration_test/test_helpers.dart`, `hibiki/integration_test/user_path_test.dart`, `hibiki/test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart`
- root cause: Windows integration tests treated any `Icons.menu_book` in the widget tree as proof that the home page was ready. That icon can appear in unrelated content, so the tests could start navigation before the primary home navigation had actually rendered.
- impact: Windows drive runs could fail or become noisy by tapping navigation targets before the app reached the home shell, especially when startup timing is slow or another page/surface includes a book icon.
- fix: added `isHomeReady()` based on the shared primary navigation target resolver and changed both home wait paths to use it. The new widget test proves an unrelated book icon no longer marks the home shell ready.
- verification: TDD red check failed as expected because `isHomeReady()` did not exist. After the fix, `flutter test test/integration/navigation_helpers_test.dart` passed with 7 tests. `dart format .` completed with 0 changed files. Full `flutter test` is currently blocked by unrelated dirty-worktree compile errors in `reader_hoshi_page.dart`, `hoshi_settings_page.dart`, and `app_model.dart` around `shouldDisablePopupScrim` / `disableDialogScrim` symbols; those files already have non-round changes and were not included in this fix.

### Next Scope
- Continue replacing broad Windows drive probes with assertions tied to the actual navigation shell, reader surface, and dictionary result surface.

## Round 11: Desktop Lookup Routing

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/models/app_model.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- Current dirty lookup-path changes that route selection/search actions through `openPopupDictionaryLookup()`

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-021
- severity: high
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/models/app_model.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the current lookup refactor routed all recursive dictionary searches through `openPopupDictionaryLookup()`, but that method unconditionally launched `hibiki://lookup?word=...`. The `hibiki://lookup` intent is only registered in Android manifest for `PopupDictActivity`; Windows has no equivalent protocol registration, so desktop lookup actions could leave the app or fail at the OS URL layer instead of opening Hibiki's dictionary UI.
- impact: Windows CJK lookup from selection menus, creator enhancements, stash/text segmentation search, and other shared lookup actions could stop being an in-app UI flow. Passing screenshots or a green app launch would not prove this path because the failure is in the action routing contract.
- fix: kept Android on the existing native popup intent path, and added a desktop/non-Android branch that opens `PopupDictionaryPage` inside a normal Flutter `Dialog`. `PopupDictionaryPage` now supports an optional in-app close callback and exposes a keyed close button for deterministic widget evidence; it still uses the native `PopupChannel.finishPopup()` when launched as the Android popup entrypoint.
- verification: TDD red check first failed because `PopupDictionaryPage` had no in-app close contract. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart` passed with 2 tests, including a desktop lookup assertion that no `url_launcher` call is made. `dart format .` completed; full `flutter test` passed with 745 tests. The stale Round 10 note about `disableDialogScrim` / `shouldDisablePopupScrim` compile blockers is superseded by current evidence: the present worktree compiles and tests cleanly.

### Next Scope
- Continue auditing desktop lookup UX at the widget/logic level first: popup sizing under small Windows windows, search submission inside the in-app dialog, and nested result popups. Full Windows drive should still wait until it will not steal focus from the user's active desktop session.

## Round 12: Desktop Popup Search Targets

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- Windows/CJK popup dictionary search targeting without launching a focused desktop runner.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-022
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the new in-app desktop lookup dialog exposed a keyed close button, but its search `TextField` and search `IconButton` were still anonymous widgets. Future Windows drive tests would have to fall back to scanning for the first text field or search icon, repeating the same false-targeting problem already fixed for the home dictionary page.
- impact: CJK lookup validation inside the desktop popup could type into or tap the wrong widget if another text field or search icon is present in the same widget tree, producing flaky or false-positive Windows UI evidence.
- fix: added stable `ValueKey<String>` identifiers for `popup_dictionary_search_field` and `popup_dictionary_search_button`.
- verification: TDD red check failed because `popup_dictionary_search_field` was missing. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart` passed with 3 tests. This is a widget-level non-focus-stealing verification path; no Windows runner was launched.

### Next Scope
- Continue desktop popup lookup review with search submission/result evidence and nested popup positioning under constrained Windows dialog sizes.

## Round 13: Desktop Popup Search Submit

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- Windows/CJK popup dictionary search submission without launching a focused desktop runner.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-023
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- root cause: Round 12 proved that desktop popup search controls were targetable, but not that either the icon button or keyboard search action actually submitted the user's query into the lookup flow. That left a UI false-state hole: a Windows test could type into a visible field and still never prove the submit contract.
- impact: CJK popup lookup validation could pass on widget presence alone while the real button or Enter/search-key path was disconnected, whitespace-polluted, or untestable without starting a focus-stealing Windows runner.
- fix: extracted the search row into `PopupDictionarySearchBar`, kept the same stable keys, and made both the icon button and `TextInputAction.search` use one typed submit path that trims input and ignores empty queries before delegating to the page search handler.
- verification: TDD red check failed as expected because `PopupDictionarySearchBar` did not exist. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart` passed with 5 tests, including button-submit and keyboard-submit cases. Full `flutter test` passed with 748 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with existing CMake/WebView2/native warnings. This remains a widget-level non-focus-stealing verification path.

### Next Scope
- Continue desktop popup lookup review with nested result popup positioning and constrained Windows dialog sizes; avoid screenshot-only conclusions unless backed by bounds or widget evidence.

## Round 14: Constrained Popup Positioning

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`
- Shared nested popup positioning used by dictionary pages and reader popup surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-024
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`
- root cause: `calcPopupPosition()` used fixed padding as the lower clamp bound even when the available popup surface was smaller than `padding * 2`. In a constrained Windows dialog, tiny transient layout, or test harness surface, `clamp(padding, screen - size - padding)` could receive inverted bounds and throw before any UI could render.
- impact: normal desktop windows may look fine, but constrained popup/dialog layouts could crash or produce no nested result popup. A screenshot from a normal-sized window would miss this because the failure is a geometry precondition bug.
- fix: normalized the usable inset from the actual screen size first, then derived width, height, and left/top clamp bounds from that usable rectangle. This keeps regular desktop dimensions capped by `maxWidth`/`maxHeight` while making tiny surfaces degrade into an in-bounds rectangle instead of throwing.
- verification: TDD red check failed with `Invalid argument(s): 6.0` in `double.clamp`. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart` passed with 2 tests covering tiny constrained surfaces and normal 800x600 desktop bounds. Full `flutter test` passed with 750 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with the rendered popup layer stack under constrained dialog sizes and verify whether result WebView content gets stable height without overflow.

## Round 15: Compact Desktop Popup Dialog

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/models/app_model.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- In-app desktop popup dictionary dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-025
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/models/app_model.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- root cause: no production defect found in this round. The risk was that the non-Android popup dictionary path wraps `PopupDictionaryPage` in `Dialog(insetPadding: EdgeInsets.all(24))` plus `ConstrainedBox(maxWidth: 520, maxHeight: 640)`, and a compact desktop window might overflow or render outside the viewport.
- impact: if this had failed, Windows lookup validation could show a normal screenshot at large size while compact windows clipped or hid the popup. The widget check did not reproduce that failure.
- fix: no layout code change. Added a non-focus-stealing widget regression test that opens the desktop popup in a 320x240 test window and asserts no Flutter exception plus an in-bounds dialog rectangle.
- verification: `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart --plain-name "desktop popup dialog renders inside a compact window"` passed. Full `flutter test` passed with 751 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning. This is recorded as verified-pass, not fixed.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with popup result WebView content sizing and empty/loading states under compact popup surfaces.

## Round 16: Compact Popup Empty State

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/utils/components/jidoujisho_placeholder_message.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`
- `hibiki/test/widgets/jidoujisho_placeholder_message_test.dart`
- Empty/loading dictionary popup content under compact desktop popup surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-026
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/utils/components/jidoujisho_placeholder_message.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`, `hibiki/test/widgets/jidoujisho_placeholder_message_test.dart`
- root cause: `DictionaryPopupLayer` reused the generic page-level `JidoujishoPlaceholderMessage` for no-result popup content. That component defaults to a large icon plus title-sized text, and its `iconSize` parameter was declared but ignored, so the popup could not request a compact placeholder. In a small popup surface this produced a `RenderFlex overflowed` exception.
- impact: desktop lookup could render fine in a normal window while compact dialog surfaces, constrained nested popups, or test harness sizes overflowed in the no-result state. This is a real UI layout bug, not a screenshot artifact.
- fix: made `JidoujishoPlaceholderMessage.iconSize` actually control the icon size, and changed the popup no-result state to use a compact, scrollable placeholder with smaller icon/text and padding.
- verification: TDD red check failed with `A RenderFlex overflowed by 210 pixels on the bottom` for an 80x48 popup surface. A second red check proved `iconSize` was ignored (`expected 18`, actual `28.0`). After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart` passed with 3 tests, `flutter test test/widgets/jidoujisho_placeholder_message_test.dart` passed with 4 tests, full `flutter test` passed with 754 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with popup WebView result content sizing and nested popup stack behavior after result links/selections.

## Round 17: Reader Popup Bottom Reserve Bounds

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`
- Current dirty reader popup bottom-reserve path in `BaseSourcePage` / `ReaderHoshiPage`.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-027
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`
- root cause: the current reader popup bottom-reserve path subtracts bottom chrome height from the available popup surface, but `calcPopupPosition()` treated the reserve as always smaller than the surface. If a compact Windows window, transient layout, or oversized bottom chrome made `bottomReserve >= screen.height`, the vertical clamp bounds inverted and threw `Invalid argument(s): 6.0`.
- impact: the normal reader screenshot can look correct, while compact windows or chrome-heavy layouts can crash or hide lookup popups when the reader tries to avoid the bottom controls.
- fix: clamp `bottomReserve` to the screen height and derive horizontal and vertical insets separately. Vertical sizing now uses the effective area above the reserved bottom chrome, so the function preserves the bottom-avoidance behavior without letting impossible reserves break popup placement.
- verification: TDD red check failed with `Invalid argument(s): 6.0` when `bottomReserve` exceeded a compact surface. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart` passed with 5 tests, full `flutter test` passed with 755 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with popup WebView result content sizing and nested popup stack behavior after result links/selections.

## Round 18: Popup WebView Metadata Merge

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_webview.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_webview_test.dart`
- Dictionary popup WebView JSON contract used by Windows desktop popup results.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-028
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_webview.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_webview_test.dart`
- root cause: `buildLookupEntriesJson()` groups entries by `word + reading`, but initialized `matched`, `deinflectionTrace`, `frequencies`, and `pitches` only from the first entry in each group. When the first glossary entry had no metadata and a later grouped entry carried frequency or pitch data, the WebView received empty metadata arrays.
- impact: the visible popup could look fine on a normal screenshot while still omitting frequency or pitch sections depending on dictionary ordering. That is a real data-contract bug in the Windows popup result path, not a visual-only artifact.
- fix: decode each entry's `extra` once, then merge metadata into the grouped result across the whole group. Frequency and pitch payloads are deduplicated by their encoded JSON value so repeated glossary entries from the same Hoshi term do not duplicate metadata blocks.
- verification: TDD red check failed because a later grouped entry's `frequencies` and `pitches` were dropped. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_popup_webview_test.dart` passed, full `flutter test` passed with 756 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with nested popup stack behavior after result links/selections, especially link-click geometry and recursive lookup result state.

## Round 19: Popup Tap-Outside Wiring

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- Independent desktop/Android popup dictionary base result layer close behavior.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-029
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- root cause: `DictionaryPopupWebView` emits `tapOutside` when the user clicks blank popup content, and nested popup layers plus reader popups already wire that callback to dismiss. The independent `PopupDictionaryPage` base layer did not pass `onTapOutside`, so the JavaScript handler was installed but had no page action.
- impact: in the Windows in-app popup and Android popup activity, clicking blank result content could look like a valid outside-dismiss gesture but do nothing. A screenshot would not catch this because the visible layout is fine; the callback contract was missing.
- fix: passed `_close` as `onTapOutside` for the base popup layer, matching the existing close button and nested-layer behavior.
- verification: TDD red check failed with `DictionaryPopupLayer.onTapOutside == null` for the base layer. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart` passed with 7 tests, full `flutter test` passed with 757 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with existing third-party/native warnings only.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with popup result content layout under long expressions, large structured content, and image/table-heavy dictionary entries.

## Round 20: Popup Structured Content Layout

### Scope
- `hibiki/assets/popup/popup.css`
- `hibiki/assets/popup/popup.js`
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/popup_asset_behavior_test.js`
- Long expressions, large images, and structured table content inside Windows popup result WebView.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-030
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/assets/popup/popup.css`, `hibiki/assets/popup/popup.js`, `hibiki/test/utils/misc/popup_asset_behavior_test.js`
- root cause: no production defect found in this round. The risk was that long terms, image-heavy entries, or wide structured-content tables could overflow a compact Windows popup result surface even when ordinary screenshots looked fine.
- impact: if this regressed, CJK lookup results with large dictionary media or wide tables would clip horizontally or force the popup content outside its intended bounds.
- fix: no production code change. Added an asset-level regression test proving structured-content tables render inside `.gloss-sc-table-container`, matching the existing CSS horizontal-scroll guard. Existing asset tests already cover oversized image scroll wrappers and natural image sizing.
- verification: `node test/utils/misc/popup_asset_behavior_test.js` passed after extending the fake DOM with `hasAttribute()`. `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_popup_webview_test.dart` passed, `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart` passed with 7 tests, full `flutter test` passed with 757 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with remaining Windows popup host paths, especially Android popup activity parity versus in-app desktop popup behavior and any unverified generated/dirty UI changes.

## Round 21: Reader Highlight Popup Geometry

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/reader/reader_selection_scripts.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/base_source_page.dart`
- `hibiki/assets/popup/selection.js`
- `hibiki/test/reader/reader_selection_scripts_test.dart`
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/popup_asset_behavior_test.js`
- Hoshi reader lookup popup geometry after dictionary result highlighting on Windows-sized layouts.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-031
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/reader/reader_selection_scripts.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/base_source_page.dart`, `hibiki/assets/popup/selection.js`, `hibiki/test/reader/reader_selection_scripts_test.dart`, `hibiki/test/utils/misc/popup_asset_behavior_test.js`
- root cause: the selection highlight code was moving from a fire-and-forget contract to a geometry-returning contract, but the contract needed to be explicit and tested. Without using the returned highlighted-range bounds, the reader popup could stay anchored to the original tap/selection rectangle even after the dictionary result highlighted a shorter matched expression.
- impact: a normal screenshot can look fine when the original selection and matched expression overlap closely, while Windows reader lookup popups can drift or feel badly placed for longer selected sentences, deinflected matches, or compact reader chrome layouts.
- fix: made `highlightSelection()` return explicit bounds in both the Hoshi reader selection script and popup asset script, JSON-stringified the reader invocation, added a typed Dart parser for bridge results, and updated `ReaderHoshiPage` to reposition the active popup from the real highlighted bounds when available. Invalid or missing bounds now fall back to the existing popup position instead of crashing.
- verification: `flutter test test/reader/reader_selection_scripts_test.dart` passed with 27 tests. `node test/utils/misc/popup_asset_behavior_test.js` passed and now checks the popup asset highlight bounds contract. `dart format .` changed 0 files. Full `flutter test` passed with 761 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` was attempted, but MSBuild could not copy `WebView2Loader.dll` because the running process `Hibiki (191208)` had the existing debug DLL locked; no app process was killed because the user is actively using the computer.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with remaining dirty Windows popup host paths that do not require stealing focus, especially `PopupDictActivity` window flags and the current popup swipe-dismiss/desktop search-field deltas.

## Round 22: Popup Host Swipe And Deferred Display

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`
- `hibiki/android/app/src/main/java/app/hibiki/reader/PopupDictActivity.java`
- `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- Remaining Windows/desktop popup host UI deltas that do not require stealing focus.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-032
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_popup_layer.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/popup_dictionary_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart`
- root cause: `DictionaryPopupLayer` always wrapped content in `SwipeDismissWrapper`. That behavior is useful for floating reader/nested popups, but it is wrong for the full-size popup dictionary host: a horizontal drag inside the dedicated popup window can dismiss the whole host while the user is scrolling, selecting text, or interacting with result content.
- impact: Windows in-app popup and Android popup activity content could disappear from an ordinary content gesture. A screenshot would look correct because the layout is fine; the bug is in the gesture contract.
- fix: added an explicit `swipeDismissible` flag to `DictionaryPopupLayer`, defaulting to the previous behavior, and disabled it only for the base `PopupDictionaryPage` host layer. The popup page also keeps the search/header boundary visually separate with a divider and removes TextField outline variants so the host chrome is not double-bordered.
- verification: added widget coverage proving `swipeDismissible: false` leaves the layer unwrapped and proving the base popup host layer passes `swipeDismissible == false`. `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_popup_layer_test.dart test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart test/reader/reader_selection_scripts_test.dart` passed with 41 tests. Full `flutter test` passed with 763 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

#### HBK-AUDIT-033
- severity: high
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart`
- root cause: the reader lookup popup flow was partly migrated from immediate display plus later repositioning to deferred display after highlight bounds were known. The helper was renamed to `_highlightAndShowPopup()`, but stale calls to `_highlightAndReposition()` remained in the text-selection path during the dirty state, making related Flutter tests fail to compile.
- impact: this is not a visual nit. Any test or build that includes `ReaderHoshiPage` can fail at compile time, blocking Windows UI verification entirely.
- fix: use one flow for both lyrics and normal reader selections: call `searchDictionaryResult(..., deferDisplay: true)`, evaluate the highlight bounds, and then show the deferred popup once with the final rectangle.
- verification: the compile failure was reproduced while running `flutter test test/pages/popup_dictionary_page_test.dart --plain-name "base popup layer disables swipe dismiss inside popup host"`. After the fix, that test passed, the combined targeted popup/selection tests passed with 41 tests, full `flutter test` passed with 763 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` succeeded.

#### HBK-AUDIT-034
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/android/app/src/main/java/app/hibiki/reader/PopupDictActivity.java`
- root cause: the dirty native popup activity changes were reviewed for Windows-facing popup parity. They ignore blank `hibiki://lookup?word=` inputs and clear window dimming for the transparent popup activity.
- impact: blank lookup intents no longer open an empty popup, and the Android popup behaves more like the desktop in-app popup by avoiding an extra dimmed background behind the small dictionary surface.
- fix: no additional production edit in this round beyond preserving the existing dirty native change for later Android-specific validation.
- verification: static code review only. No Android activity instrumentation was run in this Windows-focused pass.

### Next Scope
- Continue review with remaining dirty generated/i18n and lyrics overlay files only if they are actually Windows UI related; otherwise leave them out of the Windows popup/layout fix stream.

## Round 23: Lyrics Mode Selection Contract

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/media/audiobook/lyrics_mode_html.dart`
- `hibiki/test/media/audiobook/lyrics_mode_html_test.dart`
- Remaining dirty lyrics-mode WebView HTML changes, with attention to desktop/Windows pointer and text-selection behavior.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-035
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/media/audiobook/lyrics_mode_html.dart`, `hibiki/test/media/audiobook/lyrics_mode_html_test.dart`
- root cause: lyrics mode carried a hand-rolled long-press recognizer and disabled text selection on every cue. That duplicated the Hoshi selection script already injected into the page and made pointer behavior fragile on desktop-class environments: click, long press, drag selection, and cue navigation competed in the same HTML layer.
- impact: Windows/WebView pointer input could feel inconsistent: the current cue is supposed to open lookup on click, while native text selection should remain available. Disabling selection plus a custom long-press gate is the wrong data flow.
- fix: remove the cue-level `user-select: none` rules and the custom long-press handlers. The current cue click now directly calls `window.hoshiSelection.selectText(...)`; non-current cue clicks continue to call `onLyricsCueTap` for playback jump.
- verification: added `lyrics_mode_html_test.dart` coverage proving the generated HTML keeps current-cue click lookup, does not disable native selection, and does not include the old long-press event hooks. `flutter test test/media/audiobook/lyrics_mode_html_test.dart` passed with 2 tests.

#### HBK-AUDIT-036
- severity: low
- status: open
- files: `hibiki/lib/i18n/strings*.i18n.json`, `hibiki/lib/i18n/strings.g.dart`
- root cause: the remaining i18n dirty diff removes the now-unreferenced `disable_dialog_scrim` key, but the working tree version also adds UTF-8 BOM markers to locale JSON files and rewrites `strings.g.dart` with huge formatting churn.
- impact: deleting a dead key is probably fine, but committing the current dirty i18n diff would bury a one-key cleanup under generated-file noise and possible encoding drift.
- fix: do not commit the current i18n dirty state in this Windows UI round. A later cleanup should regenerate or edit the locale files in a clean UTF-8/no-BOM pass and stage only the intended key removal.
- verification: `rg -n "disable_dialog_scrim|disableDialogScrim|dialog scrim|scrim" hibiki/lib hibiki/test hibiki/android hibiki/ios` found no runtime references. No i18n files were staged in this round.

### Next Scope
- Continue only with clean, directly Windows/UI-related review items; leave i18n key cleanup for a separate encoding-safe pass.

## Round 24: Dead Popup Scrim Locale Key Cleanup

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/i18n/strings*.i18n.json`
- `hibiki/lib/i18n/strings.g.dart`
- The remaining dirty locale cleanup for the removed popup scrim setting.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-036
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/i18n/strings*.i18n.json`, `hibiki/lib/i18n/strings.g.dart`
- root cause: `disable_dialog_scrim` was left behind in all Slang locale sources and the generated dispatch file after the popup scrim setting path was removed. The first dirty working-tree state also introduced UTF-8 BOM markers and huge generated-file formatting churn, which would have made a simple cleanup unsafe to commit.
- impact: the stale key did not currently affect runtime UI, but keeping it confused the Windows popup cleanup by implying a scrim setting still existed. Committing the BOM/churn version would also make future i18n reviews noisy and brittle.
- fix: regenerate Slang from the existing locale sources, remove only the dead `disable_dialog_scrim` key from each locale JSON, rewrite locale JSON as UTF-8 without BOM, and regenerate `strings.g.dart` so only the corresponding getters and flat-map branches disappear.
- verification: `rg -n "disable_dialog_scrim|disableDialogScrim|dialog scrim|scrim" hibiki/lib hibiki/test hibiki/android hibiki/ios` produced no matches. A PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json` pass over every `*.i18n.json` succeeded and confirmed the key is absent. Byte-prefix checks confirmed locale JSON starts with `{` (`7B 0D 0A`), not BOM (`EF BB BF`). `dart run slang` succeeded after the cleanup.

### Next Scope
- Remaining uncommitted files are local iOS Flutter environment files and `.codex-test/screenshots/`; neither is a Windows UI source change. Continue broad Windows UI review from committed source and tests rather than staging local environment noise.

## Round 25: Blur Overlay Default Desktop Position

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/utils/player/blur_options.dart`
- `hibiki/test/utils/player/blur_options_test.dart`
- Default blur overlay placement on Windows-shaped player surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-037
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/utils/player/blur_options.dart`, `hibiki/test/utils/player/blur_options_test.dart`
- root cause: `ResizeableWidget` initialized its default horizontal position from `MediaQuery.size.height` instead of `MediaQuery.size.width`. The vertical default and horizontal default were both derived from height, so wide Windows windows placed the blur overlay too far left even though the saved-position path could look normal after manual adjustment.
- impact: first-use blur overlay placement was wrong on desktop-shaped windows. A screenshot of an already-saved layout could look fine, but new users or reset state would get a mispositioned overlay.
- fix: extract the default rectangle calculation into `defaultBlurRect(Size screen)` and compute `left` from `screen.width` while preserving the existing vertical quarter-screen placement and default 150x150 size.
- verification: added a failing-first widget-independent test for a `1200x600` window, where the old height-based calculation would produce `left == 225` instead of the expected centered `left == 525`. After the fix, `flutter test test/utils/player/blur_options_test.dart` passed. `dart format lib/src/utils/player/blur_options.dart test/utils/player/blur_options_test.dart` formatted the touched Dart files. Full `flutter test` passed with 765 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning. The fixed repository-wide `dart format .` command is still blocked by a transient generated `build/flutter_inappwebview_android/.transforms/.../headless_in_app_webview/*` missing-path error, so it is not counted as passed.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining media/dialog surfaces that still calculate widths from raw `MediaQuery` values, especially legacy player dialogs and settings dialogs that can overflow compact desktop windows.

## Round 26: Compact Desktop Dialog Field Widths

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/lyrics_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/websocket_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/blur_options_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- Legacy media/player dialogs using raw `MediaQuery.size.width * fraction` content widths.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-038
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/utils/misc/platform_utils.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/lyrics_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/websocket_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/blur_options_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- root cause: the lyrics and websocket dialogs sized their input content to one third of the full window width, while the blur options dialog used three quarters. On a compact Windows window such as 320px wide, the one-third rule produces about 106px of content width, which is not a usable desktop text field. The same feature class had three independent width formulas instead of one dialog-width rule.
- impact: compact desktop windows could render media/player dialogs with cramped input fields even though large-window screenshots looked fine. The bug is deterministic from the layout math and does not require screenshot evidence.
- fix: add `desktopDialogContentWidth(double availableWidth)` to the existing platform layout helpers and use it in the lyrics, websocket, and blur options dialogs. The rule keeps compact windows at a usable 256px content width and caps large desktop dialogs at 420px so they do not sprawl.
- verification: the failing-first `platform_layout_test.dart` case initially failed because `desktopDialogContentWidth` did not exist. After the fix, `flutter test test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart` passed with 10 tests, full `flutter test` passed with 766 tests, and `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining dialog surfaces that still use raw `MediaQuery` sizing or unconstrained `AlertDialog` content, then audit whether any remaining `verified-pass` items need stronger widget/runtime evidence.

## Round 27: AlertDialog Inset Evidence For Compact Width Rule

### Scope
- `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- The `desktopDialogContentWidth()` rule introduced in Round 26, checked against real Flutter `AlertDialog` insets on a compact 320x240 desktop-shaped surface.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-039
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart`
- root cause: no production defect found in this round. The risk was that the new 256px compact dialog content floor from Round 26 might still be too wide after `AlertDialog` applies its own default inset padding, which would turn a math-only fix into a real compact-window overflow.
- impact: if this had failed, the shared dialog width helper would need to account for dialog insets rather than only raw window width. That would mean Round 26 had improved text-field usability but not actually proven compact-window safety.
- fix: no production code change. Added a widget test that renders `AlertDialog(content: SizedBox(width: desktopDialogContentWidth(320)))` in a 320x240 test viewport and asserts the content rect stays inside the screen with no Flutter exception.
- verification: `flutter test test/utils/misc/platform_layout_test.dart` passed with 11 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with other dialogs and sheets that still lack compact-window widget evidence, prioritizing surfaces that collect text input or host scrollable content.

## Round 28: Tag Edit Compact Dialog Evidence

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/tag_management_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/tag_management_page_test.dart`
- Tag creation/editing dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-040
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/tag_management_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/tag_management_page_test.dart`
- root cause: no production defect found in this round. The risk was that `TagEditDialog` uses an `AlertDialog` with non-scrollable content containing a text field plus ten color swatches, which looked like a possible compact-window overflow source.
- impact: if this failed, tag creation/editing could become unusable on small Windows windows despite the rest of the app layout being constrained correctly.
- fix: no production code change. Added a widget test rendering `TagEditDialog` in a 320x240 viewport with real generated translations and asserted no Flutter exception while the text field remains present.
- verification: `flutter test test/pages/tag_management_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test. Full `flutter test` passed with 768 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with profile/media edit dialogs and any remaining input surfaces that still lack compact-window widget evidence.

## Round 29: Media Source Picker Compact Dialog Evidence

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_source_picker_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/media_source_picker_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Media source picker dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-041
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_source_picker_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/media_source_picker_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: no production defect found in this round. The risk was that `MediaSourcePickerDialogPage` uses a scrollable column containing a `Flexible` child and a shrink-wrapped `ListView`, which looked like a possible unbounded-height layout trap in compact Windows windows.
- impact: if this had failed, users could hit a layout exception when opening source selection in a small desktop window, and the picker would need a simpler bounded scroll structure.
- fix: no production code change. Added a widget test with a lightweight `AppModel` override that renders the real reader source picker in a 320x240 viewport and asserts no Flutter exception while the source row is present.
- verification: the first test harness failed because the uninitialised test `AppModel` had no locale/database state; after replacing it with a focused `PickerTestAppModel`, `flutter test test/pages/media_source_picker_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test. Full `flutter test` passed with 769 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with profile/media edit dialogs, especially surfaces with image previews or multiple action buttons where compact height can still be a real constraint.

## Round 30: Switch Settings Compact Dialog Evidence

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/switch_settings_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/switch_settings_page_test.dart`
- Generic switch settings dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-042
- severity: low
- status: verified-pass
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/switch_settings_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/switch_settings_page_test.dart`
- root cause: no production defect found in this round. The risk was that `SwitchSettingsPage` renders switch rows inside a `Wrap`, and each row contains an `Expanded` label. That pattern can be suspicious in Flutter because `Expanded` requires bounded horizontal constraints.
- impact: if this failed, generic switch-setting dialogs could throw layout exceptions or hide action buttons in compact desktop windows.
- fix: no production code change. Added a widget test rendering a two-row `SwitchSettingsPage<String>` in a 320x240 viewport and asserted no Flutter exception while both switches are present.
- verification: `flutter test test/pages/switch_settings_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test. Full `flutter test` passed with 770 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe` with the existing third-party `flutter_inappwebview_windows` CMake dev warning.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with media item editing and audio recorder dialogs, where row density and image/audio controls are more likely to produce compact-window overflow.

## Round 31: Audio Recorder Compact Dialog Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/audio_recorder_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/audio_recorder_page_test.dart`
- Audio recorder dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-043
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/audio_recorder_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/audio_recorder_page_test.dart`
- root cause: `AudioRecorderDialogPage` wrapped a non-scrollable player row in `RawScrollbar` with a private `ScrollController`, so Flutter could not attach a `ScrollPosition`. The same player row also always rendered the fixed `--:-- / --:--` time label next to a slider, which overflowed in a 320x240 compact desktop window.
- impact: opening the audio recorder dialog in a small Windows window could throw layout/debug exceptions and clip player controls. This was a real widget-test reproduction, not a screenshot-only conclusion.
- fix: removed the invalid scrollbar/controller, kept the audio player as a bounded row, moved the slider flex ownership to the row, and hid the time label below the compact width threshold so the primary play/record and slider controls remain visible.
- verification: the new compact widget test first failed with a `RenderFlex overflowed by 1.3 pixels` error and `Scrollbar's ScrollController has no ScrollPosition attached`. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/audio_recorder_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with media item editing, especially the cover override field where an image preview and two icon buttons share a `TextField.suffixIcon`.

## Round 32: Media Item Cover Field Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_item_edit_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/media_item_edit_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Media item edit dialog cover override field under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-044
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_item_edit_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/media_item_edit_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the cover override `TextField` built a large inline `suffixIcon` row containing an image preview and two wide icon buttons, with `Expanded` nested inside a suffix slot that should be explicitly bounded. That made the field hard to reason about and left compact desktop windows vulnerable to suffix overflow or hidden controls.
- impact: editing a media item in a small Windows window could crowd or clip the cover preview/actions, especially because the cover field shared the same dialog width as title editing and action buttons.
- fix: extracted `MediaItemCoverOverrideField`, constrained the suffix icon area, replaced the unbounded `Expanded` preview with a bounded `Flexible` preview, and kept the pick/undo actions in the same production path. The first attempt to test the full `MediaItemEditDialogPage` was discarded because the Reader/Hoshi/AppModel dependency chain hung during widget-test loading and did not produce layout evidence.
- verification: `flutter test test/pages/media_item_edit_dialog_page_test.dart --timeout 30s` passed with 1 focused compact-width widget test for the extracted production cover field.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining profile/media edit input surfaces and any dialog that still combines image/audio controls with narrow desktop widths.

## Round 33: Profile Name Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/profile_management_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/profile_management_page_test.dart`
- Profile create/copy/rename name input dialogs under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-045
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/profile_management_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/profile_management_page_test.dart`
- root cause: profile create/copy/rename each built the same full-density `AlertDialog` inline, with default title/content/action padding and a non-dense `TextField`. In a 320x240 desktop window the default Material vertical chrome overflowed the bottom.
- impact: users managing profiles in a small Windows window could hit a layout overflow while creating, copying, or renaming profiles.
- fix: extracted the duplicated name input dialog into `ProfileNameDialog`, gave it compact title/content/action padding, and used a dense text field while preserving the same trim-on-submit behavior for all three profile actions.
- verification: the new compact widget test first failed with `A RenderFlex overflowed by 16 pixels on the bottom`. After the compact dialog fix, `flutter test test/pages/profile_management_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining settings/profile rows that combine dropdowns or multiple trailing actions in narrow desktop widths.

## Round 34: Dictionary Progress Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_dialog_import_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_dialog_delete_page.dart`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_progress_dialog_content.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_progress_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Dictionary import/delete progress dialogs under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-046
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_dialog_import_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_dialog_delete_page.dart`, `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_progress_dialog_content.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/dictionary_progress_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: dictionary import and delete progress dialogs duplicated a full-padding `AlertDialog` body with a horizontal spinner/message row and long text column. In a 320x240 Windows window, the default vertical chrome plus long progress text exceeded the available height.
- impact: users importing or deleting dictionaries in a small desktop window could see layout overflow while the operation was in progress, exactly when the UI should be stable and non-dismissible.
- fix: introduced shared `DictionaryProgressDialogContent` with compact spinner sizing, bounded height, scrollable text content, and smaller dialog padding; both import and delete progress dialogs now use the same bounded layout.
- verification: the compact widget tests first failed with bottom overflows of 55px for import and 60px for delete. After the shared content fix, `flutter test test/pages/dictionary_progress_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 2 tests.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining dictionary/settings dialogs that have large scrollable content or multiple trailing actions.

## Round 35: Anki Handlebar Picker Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/anki_settings_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/anki_settings_page_test.dart`
- Anki field mapping handlebar picker dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-047
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/anki_settings_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/anki_settings_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the Anki handlebar picker was built inline with default `AlertDialog` padding, a full-density text field, a shrink-wrapped option list, and three action buttons. Even after extracting it, the initial compact version still allowed too much vertical chrome for a 320x240 window.
- impact: users editing Anki field mappings in a small Windows window could hit a bottom overflow instead of reliably choosing or typing a handlebar value.
- fix: extracted `AnkiHandlebarPickerDialog`, bounded the option list height against the current window, reduced title/content/action/button padding, made the text field dense, and ellipsized long option labels.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because the dialog widget did not exist, then reproduced a `RenderFlex overflowed by 112 pixels on the bottom` error. After the compact picker fix, `flutter test test/pages/anki_settings_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining settings dialogs, especially custom dictionary/audio-source editors and bottom action rows.

## Round 36: Audio Sources Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_settings_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/audio_sources_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Dictionary settings audio-source management dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-048
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/dictionary_settings_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/audio_sources_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the audio-source editor was a private dialog using default `AlertDialog` chrome, a shrink-wrapped reorderable list, full `Space.normal()` spacing that depends on a page-level `Spacing` ancestor, two-line URL labels, and normal-density icon/input controls.
- impact: when opened in a compact Windows window, the dialog could overflow vertically; when tested or reused outside the settings page shell, it also crashed because the dialog body depended on an ambient `Spacing` provider.
- fix: exposed `AudioSourcesDialog` for direct widget coverage, bounded its content height to the current window, reduced dialog padding and list/input density, ellipsized long URLs to one line, and replaced the ambient `Space.normal()` dependency with a local `SizedBox`.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because the dialog was private, then reproduced both the missing `Spacing` assertion and a bottom overflow. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/audio_sources_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with CSS/font editor dialogs and remaining confirmation dialogs that still use default `AlertDialog` padding.

## Round 37: Custom Font Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/custom_fonts_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/custom_fonts_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Custom font URL import and download progress dialogs under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-049
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/custom_fonts_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/custom_fonts_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the URL import and download progress dialogs were built inline with default `AlertDialog` title/content/action padding and unbounded long title text, which made the layout harder to test and easier to overflow in compact desktop windows.
- impact: long recommended font names or localized dialog titles could consume too much vertical chrome on small Windows windows; because the dialogs were inline, there was no direct widget coverage for this layout.
- fix: extracted `CustomFontUrlImportDialog` and `CustomFontDownloadProgressDialog`, applied compact dialog padding, dense input padding, one-line ellipsized titles/progress labels, and kept the existing import/download flow unchanged.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because both dialogs were inline and unavailable; after extraction and compact layout, `flutter test test/pages/custom_fonts_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 2 tests and full `flutter test` passed with 779 tests. `flutter build windows --debug` was blocked by an unrelated dirty `audiobook_import_dialog.dart` compile error (`_AudiobookImportDialogState.health` is undefined after a local parsed-health refactor).

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with dictionary CSS editor and remaining reader/history confirmation dialogs.

## Round 38: Book CSS Editor Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/book_css_editor_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/book_css_editor_page_test.dart`
- Book CSS editor bottom action bar and unsaved-changes confirmation dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-050
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/book_css_editor_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/book_css_editor_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the editor bottom bar used a fixed horizontal `Row` with reset/save buttons, while the unsaved/reset dialogs used default `AlertDialog` padding with long content and multiple actions. A 320x240 desktop window left no room for either layout.
- impact: opening the editor in a small Windows window could produce a right overflow in the bottom bar; switching tabs with unsaved changes could additionally produce a vertical dialog overflow.
- fix: changed the bottom bar to a compact `Wrap` inside `SafeArea`, extracted a reusable `BookCssConfirmationDialog`, reduced dialog padding, constrained and scrolled the message body, and ellipsized long titles.
- verification: the new compact widget test first reproduced a `RenderFlex overflowed by 48 pixels on the right` in the bottom bar and a `RenderFlex overflowed by 64 pixels on the bottom` in the dialog. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/book_css_editor_page_test.dart` passed with 3 tests.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with reader/history confirmation dialogs and remaining settings pages that combine long labels with horizontal action rows.

## Round 39: Book Profile Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/book_profile_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Reader history book-profile selection dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-051
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/book_profile_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: `_BookProfileDialog` rendered profile choices as an unconstrained `Column` of full-density `RadioListTile`s. The list size scaled directly with profile count instead of the window, and the dialog had default padding/title behavior.
- impact: users with many profiles could open the book profile selector in a compact Windows window and hit vertical overflow, making later profile choices unreachable or causing layout assertions in debug builds.
- fix: extracted `BookProfileDialogContent`, gave the profile list a bounded `ListView`, made radio rows compact with ellipsized labels, and reduced the dialog title/content/action padding.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because the content widget did not exist, then reproduced missing `Material` assertions plus a massive bottom overflow from the unbounded `Column`. After the fix, `flutter test test/pages/book_profile_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining delete confirmations and media item dialogs that expose long titles or many actions.

## Round 40: Reader History Delete Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/reader_history_delete_dialog_test.dart`
- Reader history EPUB/SRT delete confirmation dialogs under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-052
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_history_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/reader_history_delete_dialog_test.dart`
- root cause: the EPUB and SRT delete confirmations duplicated default `AlertDialog` layouts with unconstrained long title/message text, so compact Windows windows had no shared guard against overflow.
- impact: long book titles could make delete confirmation dialogs cramped or overflow-prone, and the two delete paths could drift independently.
- fix: extracted shared `ReaderHistoryDeleteDialog`, applied compact dialog padding, constrained and scrolled the message body, ellipsized the title, and kept the destructive action styling.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because the shared dialog did not exist. After extraction and compact layout, `flutter test test/pages/reader_history_delete_dialog_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with media item dialogs and remaining large-content settings dialogs.

## Round 41: Profile Delete Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/profile_management_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/profile_management_page_test.dart`
- Profile deletion confirmation under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-053
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/profile_management_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/profile_management_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the profile delete confirmation still used an inline default `AlertDialog`, unlike the already compacted profile name dialog. The long profile name lived in an unconstrained content body and the dialog could not be tested directly.
- impact: deleting a profile with a long name in a small Windows window could produce cramped or overflow-prone confirmation UI, and later changes could regress it without a focused widget test.
- fix: extracted `ProfileDeleteDialog`, constrained and scrolled the message body, ellipsized the title, reduced action padding, and used destructive filled-button styling.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because `ProfileDeleteDialog` did not exist. After extraction and compact layout, `flutter test test/pages/profile_management_page_test.dart` passed with 2 tests.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with collection delete confirmations and remaining default confirmation dialogs.

## Round 42: Collection Delete Dialog Compact Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/collections_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/collections_page_test.dart`
- Collection bookmark/favorite swipe-delete confirmation under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-054
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/collections_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/collections_page_test.dart`
- root cause: collection swipe-delete confirmation used an inline default `AlertDialog` with long bookmark/favorite text directly in the content slot, so compact desktop windows had no bounded scroll area or direct test coverage.
- impact: long saved sentences or bookmark labels could make the confirmation dialog cramped or overflow-prone before deletion.
- fix: extracted `CollectionDeleteDialog`, constrained and scrolled the message body, reduced dialog/action padding, and used destructive filled-button styling while preserving the existing `confirmDismiss` delete flow.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because `CollectionDeleteDialog` did not exist. After extraction and compact layout, `flutter test test/pages/collections_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with reader/media dialogs that still use default `AlertDialog` layouts and long content.

## Round 43: Media Item Dialog Compact Action Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_item_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/media_item_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Media item long-press detail dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces with long titles and multiple actions.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-055
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_item_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/media_item_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: media item detail dialogs used the default `AlertDialog` title/content/actions layout. With long media titles and four actions, Flutter's default action overflow behavior expanded vertically and left too little room in compact desktop windows.
- impact: long-pressing a media item in a small Windows window could produce a bottom overflow before the user could reliably read, edit, clear, or use source-specific actions.
- fix: extracted `MediaItemDialogFrame`, compacted dialog inset/padding, constrained the preview content, capped the media title to one line, and wrapped action buttons in a horizontal `MediaItemDialogActionStrip` instead of letting the default overflow bar grow vertically.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because `MediaItemDialogFrame` did not exist, then reproduced `RenderFlex overflowed by 120 pixels on the bottom` and later 32/14 pixel bottom overflows while tightening the frame. After the action strip fix, `flutter test test/pages/media_item_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with media edit dialogs and remaining default dialog shells.

## Round 44: Collection Item Dialog Compact Action Layout Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/collections_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/collections_page_test.dart`
- Collection long-press detail dialog with long favorite/bookmark text and multiple actions.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-056
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/collections_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/collections_page_test.dart`
- root cause: collection item detail used an inline default `AlertDialog` with long selectable text and up to four actions, leaving the compact desktop layout unbounded and untested.
- impact: future action additions or longer localized labels could regress compact Windows dialog layout without focused coverage.
- fix: extracted `CollectionItemDialogFrame`, compacted inset/padding, constrained and scrolled optional content, and wrapped actions in a horizontal `CollectionItemDialogActionStrip`.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because `CollectionItemDialogFrame` did not exist. After extraction and compact layout, `flutter test test/pages/collections_page_test.dart` passed with 2 tests.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with media edit dialog shell and remaining settings confirmation dialogs.

## Round 45: Media Item Edit Dialog Compact Frame Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_item_edit_dialog_page.dart`
- `hibiki/test/pages/media_item_edit_dialog_page_test.dart`
- Media item edit dialog shell with title override field, cover override field, and save/cancel actions.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-062
- severity: low
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/media_item_edit_dialog_page.dart`, `hibiki/test/pages/media_item_edit_dialog_page_test.dart`
- root cause: the media item edit dialog used a raw `AlertDialog` with content padding but no compact-window height constraint around its stacked text and cover fields.
- impact: future cover-field changes or localized action labels could push the edit dialog past compact Windows window bounds without a focused shell test.
- fix: extracted `MediaItemEditDialogFrame`, added compact inset/action padding, constrained and scrolled dialog content, and left the existing title/cover save flow unchanged.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because `MediaItemEditDialogFrame` did not exist. After extraction and compact layout, `flutter test test/pages/media_item_edit_dialog_page_test.dart` passed with 2 tests.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining settings confirmation dialogs and large-form dialogs.

## Round 46: Book Import Dialog Compact Frame Fix

### Scope
- `hibiki/lib/src/media/audiobook/book_import_dialog.dart`
- `hibiki/test/media/audiobook/book_import_dialog_test.dart`
- Unified EPUB/SRT/audio/cover import dialog under compact Windows-sized surfaces.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-063
- severity: medium
- status: fixed
- files: `hibiki/lib/src/media/audiobook/book_import_dialog.dart`, `hibiki/test/media/audiobook/book_import_dialog_test.dart`
- root cause: `BookImportDialog` used a raw `AlertDialog` for a large multi-field import form. The form was scrollable internally, but the dialog shell had no compact-window height contract or direct widget coverage.
- impact: adding matcher controls, progress text, or longer localized labels could push the import dialog beyond a small Windows window, and this path is a primary import workflow rather than a rare settings confirmation.
- fix: extracted `BookImportDialogFrame`, compacted dialog inset/padding, constrained form height, and kept the existing import/cancel actions and import logic unchanged.
- verification: the compact widget test first failed because `BookImportDialogFrame` did not exist. A first implementation accidentally placed the frame inside the state class and failed compilation; after moving it to top level and restoring the method braces, `flutter test test/media/audiobook/book_import_dialog_test.dart` passed with 1 test.

### Next Scope
- Continue Windows UI review with remaining import/settings dialogs; stop only after a final no-blocker pass is recorded.

## Round 56: Audiobook SrtBook Fallback & Import Atomicity Code Review

### Scope
- Commits: `22f916ac`, `43ea6f48`, `5d25bc47`, `905b0909`
- `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/reader_hoshi_page.dart` — `_resolveAudioSlot`, `_primeAudioCuesForCurrentBook`, `_initSrtBookController`, `_buildSrtChapterMap`, `_onCueChanged`, `_syncPositionFromCurrentCue`, `_restoreFromCurrentAudioCue`, `_toggleLyricsMode`, `_exitLyricsMode`, `_handleCueCrossChapter`, `_handleBoundarySkip`, `dispose`

- `packages/fushi_audio/lib/src/matching/cues_to_epub.dart` — `splitChapters`
- All 17 i18n locale files — `audio_panel_pick_new_subtitle` key

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-057 — All five original changes verified correct
- severity: info
- status: verified
- files: `reader_hoshi_page.dart`, `audiobook_import_dialog.dart`, `audiobook_repository.dart`
- summary:
  1. `_resolveAudioSlot`: Independent `if` checks (not `else if`) — when Audiobook exists but has no audio files, `_initAudiobookController` returns without setting `_audiobookController`, so the second `if (_audiobookController == null && srt != null)` correctly falls back to SrtBook. ✅
  2. `_primeAudioCuesForCurrentBook`: Detects flat `srt://default` cues via `allCues.every((c) => c.chapterHref == SrtParser.defaultChapter)`, loads all cues as chapter cues to avoid empty chapter-filtered result. ✅
  3. `_initSrtBookController`: 5 preference reads (`followAudio`, `delayMs`, `speed`, `positionMs`, `imagePauseSec`) via `Future.wait` + 5 persistence callbacks (`onPositionWrite`, `onDelayPersist`, `onSpeedPersist`, `onImagePausePersist`, `onFollowAudioPersist`). All callbacks have explicit type annotations. ✅
  4. `deleteAudiobook`: Delegates to `_db.deleteAudiobookByBookUid()` (which internally deletes cues then audiobook) + filesystem cleanup. No redundant transaction wrapper. ✅
  5. Import flow: `_parseCues` returns `({health, cues})` record without writing to database. `_doImport` calls `saveAudiobook` → `saveCues` → `updateHealthOverlay` in correct order. "替换字幕" button via `_enterReplaceSubtitleMode` preserves existing audio sources and pre-populates alignment path. ✅
- verification: flutter analyze (0 errors/warnings), flutter test (786/786 passed)

#### HBK-AUDIT-058 — Cross-chapter sync parity between Sasayaki and SRT paths
- severity: info
- status: verified
- files: `reader_hoshi_page.dart` lines 1797–1832
- summary: Both Sasayaki and SRT cross-chapter paths in `_onCueChanged` call all three sync methods (`_syncPositionFromCurrentCue`, `_syncFloatingLyric`, `_syncMediaNotification`). Design difference is intentional: Sasayaki relies on controller's `onCrossChapter` callback for chapter navigation; SRT handles navigation directly in `_onCueChanged` because the controller has no SRT chapter awareness. SRT path correctly gates navigation on `shouldRevealCurrentCue && !_restoreInFlight`.

#### HBK-AUDIT-059 — Empty cue guard in _buildSrtChapterMap
- severity: info
- status: verified
- files: `reader_hoshi_page.dart` line 491, `cues_to_epub.dart` line 96
- summary: `CuesToEpub.splitChapters([])` returns `[[]]` (list with one empty list). `_buildSrtChapterMap` has an early `if (cues.isEmpty) return` guard that prevents `.first` on the empty inner list. The guard was added in commit `905b0909`. ✅

#### HBK-AUDIT-060 — Import atomicity is order-correct but not transactional
- severity: low
- status: accepted
- files: `audiobook_import_dialog.dart` lines 692–700
- root cause: `saveAudiobook` → `saveCues` → `updateHealthOverlay` are three independent database calls without a wrapping transaction. If `saveCues` fails after `saveAudiobook` succeeds, an audiobook record exists with stale/no cues.
- impact: Extremely narrow failure window (milliseconds between calls). Both `saveAudiobook` (upsert) and `saveCues` (replace-all) are idempotent — re-importing recovers cleanly. The old code was worse: `saveCues` ran inside `_parseCues` BEFORE `saveAudiobook`, creating orphan cues on failure.
- recommendation: Not worth adding a cross-repository transaction at this time. The idempotent nature of both operations makes manual recovery trivial. Mark as accepted risk.

#### HBK-AUDIT-061 — Lifecycle completeness
- severity: info
- status: verified
- files: `reader_hoshi_page.dart` `dispose()` (lines 769–801)
- summary: All 4 media stream subscriptions (`_playStreamSub`, `_seekStreamSub`, `_skipNextSub`, `_skipPrevSub`) cancelled. Audiobook controller listener removed and controller disposed. Position flushed to persistent storage. Floating lyric hidden and media notification cleared. Wakelock disabled in try/catch. ✅

### Conclusion
All five targeted changes are correctly implemented and verified by static analysis + 786 unit tests. The commit chain (22f916ac → 43ea6f48 → 5d25bc47 → 905b0909) progressively tightened the implementation from base fix through feature addition, review findings, and edge case guards. One accepted low-severity risk (non-transactional import) is mitigated by idempotent operations. No code changes required.

### Next Scope
- Runtime verification on emulator: SrtBook fallback path (import SRT-only book), "替换字幕" button flow, play/pause/seek/skip controls, lyrics mode toggle.

## Round 47: Windows Compact UI Final No-Blocker Pass

### Scope
- Remaining short/default dialog shells after the Windows compact UI fixes:
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/language_dialog_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/websocket_dialog_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/lyrics_dialog_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/example_sentences_dialog_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/text_segmentation_dialog_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/miscellaneous_settings_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/open_stash_dialog_page.dart`
  - `hibiki/lib/src/pages/implementations/hoshi_settings_page.dart`
- Previously fixed high-risk compact surfaces in this pass: reader/history confirmations, profile dialogs, collection dialogs, media item dialogs, media edit dialog, and book import dialog.

### Findings

#### HBK-AUDIT-064
- severity: info
- status: verified
- files: see Scope
- root cause: no remaining blocker found in the sampled short/default dialogs. The remaining `AlertDialog` usages are either short confirmation text, simple lists/content already naturally scrollable, or settings dialogs whose high-risk long-form/multi-action peers now have compact frame tests.
- impact: no code change required in this final pass. Continuing to mechanically replace every short default dialog would add abstraction without a reproduced compact-window failure.
- fix: no runtime change. Kept the review boundary explicit and preserved existing behavior.
- verification: final no-blocker pass used source search for remaining `AlertDialog` / `showDialog` call sites, compared them against the new compact widget-test coverage, and left only low-risk short/simple dialogs unmodified. Latest verified code state before this doc-only pass: `flutter test` passed with 788 tests, `flutter build windows --debug` built `build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\hibiki.exe`, and targeted compact tests passed for the newly added dialog frames.

### Next Scope
- No blocking Windows compact UI issue remains in the reviewed dialog/layout scope. Future work should be driven by a concrete failing widget test, user report, or runtime evidence rather than blanket replacement of short default dialogs.
