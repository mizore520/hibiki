#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fully-automated, EMULATOR-ONLY integration test runner for Fushi.
#
# One command: boots/selects an emulator, builds the debug APK once, provisions
# every prerequisite (AnkiDroid + a collection + permission grant, dictionary
# fixture on /sdcard), then runs EVERY integration_test target and aggregates
# the results. No real device, no manual `flutter drive`, no manual adb
# push/tap. A real (physical) device is deliberately ignored — only serials
# matching emulator-<port> are used.
#
# Usage:
#   bash ci/integration-test.sh                      # boot/select emulator, run all
#   bash ci/integration-test.sh --skip-build         # reuse the existing app-debug.apk
#   bash ci/integration-test.sh --only=app_smoke,reader_pagination
#   bash ci/integration-test.sh --avd=fushi_gpu_test
#
# Env overrides: ADB, EMULATOR, FLUTTER, AVD, PKG, DICT_ZIP, ANKI_APK_URL
#
# NOTE: this runner does NOT use `set -e` — a failing target must not abort the
# remaining targets; failures are collected and reported in the final summary.
