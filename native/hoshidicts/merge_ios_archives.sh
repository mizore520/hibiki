# the iOS Runner Xcode target force_loads, so the FFI symbols land in the Runner
# executable image (where Dart's DynamicLibrary.process() resolves them).
#
# Invoked as a POST_BUILD step on the CMake hoshidicts_ffi target. The iOS build
# uses CMake's default single-config generator (matching macOS), so every
# archive lands at a flat, deterministic path under the build dir. Args:
#   $1 = CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
#   $2 = output merged archive path
