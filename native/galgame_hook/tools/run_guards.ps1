# Single entry point for the galgame_hook source-of-truth guards.
#
# Why this file exists instead of an inline multi-line `run:` block:
# GitHub Actions `shell: pwsh` steps only honour the exit code of the LAST
# command in the block. Every earlier native command that fails is silently
# swallowed and the step still reports success. The now-deleted voice-hook-helper.yml's
# "Verify engine support manifest" step listed seven commands that way, so six
# of the seven guards were decorative -- proven in practice: the generated
# include/luna_hook_profiles.inc drifted away from config/luna_hook_profiles.tsv
# at the subtree import (commit bc094b89b) and `generate_luna_profiles.py
# --check` has returned 1 ever since, while run 30217258807 still reported that
# step as green.
#
# Invoke-Checked below makes swallowing structurally impossible: every guard's
# exit code is asserted, so a red guard is always a red job.
#
# Deliberately ASCII-only and pwsh/PowerShell-5.1 safe: it is executed by
# ubuntu-latest pwsh (PR gate) and by hand.
# All guards are pure verification -- no writes, no network, no publishing.
