REM Build + run the word-boundary scan-candidate guard test on Windows.
REM Pure in-memory (no DB/FFI); only depends on utfcpp (header-only).
REM Do NOT redirect vcvars output to nul (it breaks subsequent cl with 9009).

REM Include dirs mirror the real CMake lib build (NO -I fushidicts_src): the .cpp
REM self-includes its own-dir header bare; only point at scan/ + utfcpp.
